# Cerebras API Integration PR

### Description

This PR adds comprehensive Cerebras API support to Cline, enabling users to access Cerebras's high-performance inference platform with 5 different models including reasoning-capable models.

**Key Features Added:**
- **Native Cerebras SDK Integration**: Uses `@cerebras/cerebras_cloud_sdk` for optimal performance and compatibility
- **5 Cerebras Models**: llama3.1-8b (default), llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct, llama-3.3-70b, qwen-3-32b, and deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
- **Reasoning Support**: Qwen and DeepSeek R1 Distill models support `<think>` tag handling for enhanced reasoning capabilities
- **Streaming Responses**: Full streaming support with proper error handling and real-time token usage tracking
- **Cost Calculation**: Token counting and cost tracking (set to free/$0 for all models)
- **UI Integration**: Complete settings UI with API key configuration, model selection dropdown, and help links
- **Proper Context Windows**: 8192 tokens for Llama models, 16384 tokens for Qwen models

**Problem Solved:**
Users can now leverage Cerebras's ultra-fast inference speeds (2000+ tokens/second) directly within Cline, providing an alternative high-performance API provider option alongside existing providers like Anthropic, OpenRouter, and others.

### Test Procedure

**Testing Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **API Key Configuration**: Tested API key input, validation, and secure storage
- ‚úÖ **Model Selection**: Verified all 5 models appear in dropdown and can be selected
- ‚úÖ **Basic Chat**: Confirmed successful API requests and streaming responses
- ‚úÖ **Reasoning Models**: Tested `<think>` tag handling with qwen-3-32b and deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Verified proper error messages for invalid API keys and network issues
- ‚úÖ **Token Tracking**: Confirmed usage statistics are properly calculated and displayed
- ‚úÖ **UI Integration**: Tested settings panel, help links, and model descriptions
- ‚úÖ **TypeScript Compilation**: All code compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ **Webview Build**: React components build successfully

**Confidence Level: High**
- Follows established patterns from other API providers (SambaNova, XAI, etc.)
- Uses official Cerebras SDK with proper error handling
- Comprehensive logging added during development and removed for production
- All TypeScript types properly defined and validated

### Additional Notes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/api/providers/cerebras.ts` - New Cerebras API handler
- `src/api/index.ts` - Registered Cerebras handler
- `src/shared/api.ts` - Added Cerebras models and types
- `src/core/storage/state-keys.ts` - Added cerebrasApiKey to SecretKey type
- `src/core/storage/state.ts` - Updated secret storage functions
- `webview-ui/src/components/settings/ApiOptions.tsx` - Added Cerebras UI integration
- `package.json` - Added @cerebras/cerebras_cloud_sdk dependency
- `README.md` - Updated to include Cerebras in supported providers
- `.clinerules/cline-overview.md` - Added Cerebras to provider documentation
