## Writing and Submitting Code

Anyone can contribute code to Cline, but we ask that you follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions can be smoothly integrated:

1. **Keep Pull Requests Focused**

    - Limit PRs to a single feature or bug fix
    - Split larger changes into smaller, related PRs
    - Break changes into logical commits that can be reviewed independently

2. **Code Quality**

    - Run `npm run lint` to ensure code follows our style guidelines
    - Run `npm run format` to format your code with Prettier
    - Address any ESLint warnings or errors before submitting
    - Follow TypeScript best practices and maintain type safety

3. **Testing**

    - Add tests for new features
    - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
    - Update existing tests if your changes affect them
    - Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate

4. **Commit Guidelines**

    - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
    - Use conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "docs:")
    - Reference relevant issues in commits using #issue-number

5. **Before Submitting**

    - Rebase your branch on the latest main
    - Ensure your branch builds successfully
    - Double-check all tests are passing
    - Review your changes for any debugging code or console logs

6. **Pull Request Description**
    - Clearly describe what your changes do
    - Include steps to test the changes
    - List any breaking changes
    - Add screenshots for UI changes
