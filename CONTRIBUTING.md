## Before Contributing

All contributions must begin with a GitHub Issue, unless the change is for small bug fixes, typo corrections, minor wording improvements, or simple type fixes that don't change functionality.

- **Check existing issues**: Search [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues).
- **Create an issue**: Use appropriate templates:
    - **Contributions:** Use the "Contribution Request" template to propose what you'd like to work on.
    - **Bugs:** "Bug Report" template for reporting issues.
    - **Features:** "Detailed Feature Proposal" template for suggesting new features.
- **Wait for approval**: A core Cline contributor must approve your contribution request before you start implementation.
- **Claim issues**: Once approved, the issue will be assigned to you.

**PRs without approved issues may be closed.**


## Deciding What to Work On

Looking for a good first contribution? Check out issues labeled ["good first issue"](https://github.com/cline/cline/labels/good%20first%20issue) or ["help wanted"](https://github.com/cline/cline/labels/help%20wanted). These are specifically curated for new contributors and areas where we'd love some help!

We also welcome contributions to our [documentation](https://github.com/cline/cline/tree/main/docs)! Whether it's fixing typos, improving existing guides, or creating new educational content - we'd love to build a community-driven repository of resources that helps everyone get the most out of Cline. You can start by diving into `/docs` and looking for areas that need improvement.

## Development Setup


### Local Development Instructions

1. Clone the repository _(Requires [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/))_:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cline/cline.git
    ```
2. Open the project in VSCode:
    ```bash
    code cline
    ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies for the extension and webview-gui:
    ```bash
    npm run install:all
    ```
4. Launch by pressing `F5` (or `Run`->`Start Debugging`) to open a new VSCode window with the extension loaded. (You may need to install the [esbuild problem matchers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.esbuild-problem-matchers) if you run into issues building the project.)




### Creating a Pull Request

1. Before creating a PR, generate a changeset entry:
    ```bash
    npm run changeset
    ```
   This will prompt you for:
   - Type of change (major, minor, patch)
     - `major` ‚Üí breaking changes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
     - `minor` ‚Üí new features (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
     - `patch` ‚Üí bug fixes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
   - Description of your changes

2. Commit your changes and the generated `.changeset` file

3. Push your branch and create a PR on GitHub. Our CI will:
   - Run tests and checks
   - Changesetbot will create a comment showing the version impact
   - When merged to main, changesetbot will create a Version Packages PR
   - When the Version Packages PR is merged, a new release will be published
4. Testing
    - Run `npm run test` to run tests locally. 
    - Before submitting PR, run `npm run format:fix` to format your code
    - Run `npm run test:ci` to run tests locally

### Extension

1. **VS Code Extensions**

    - When opening the project, VS Code will prompt you to install recommended extensions
    - These extensions are required for development - please accept all installation prompts
    - If you dismissed the prompts, you can install them manually from the Extensions panel

2. **Local Development**
    - Run `npm run install:all` to install dependencies
    - Run `npm run test` to run tests locally
    - Run ‚Üí Start Debugging or `>Debug: Select and Start Debugging` and wait for a new VS Code instance to open
    - Before submitting PR, run `npm run format:fix` to format your code

3. **Linux-specific Setup**
    VS Code extension tests on Linux require the following system libraries:

    - `dbus`
    - `libasound2`
    - `libatk-bridge2.0-0`
    - `libatk1.0-0`
    - `libdrm2`
    - `libgbm1`
    - `libgtk-3-0`
    - `libnss3`
    - `libx11-xcb1`
    - `libxcomposite1`
    - `libxdamage1`
    - `libxfixes3`
    - `libxkbfile1`
    - `libxrandr2`
    - `xvfb`

    These libraries provide necessary GUI components and system services for the test environment.

    For example, on Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu), you can install these libraries using apt:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y \
      dbus \
      libasound2 \
      libatk-bridge2.0-0 \
      libatk1.0-0 \
      libdrm2 \
      libgbm1 \
      libgtk-3-0 \
      libnss3 \
      libx11-xcb1 \
      libxcomposite1 \
      libxdamage1 \
      libxfixes3 \
      libxkbfile1 \
      libxrandr2 \
      xvfb
    ```

## Writing and Submitting Code

Anyone can contribute code to Cline, but we ask that you follow these guidelines to ensure your contributions can be smoothly integrated:

1. **Keep Pull Requests Focused**

    - Limit PRs to a single feature or bug fix
    - Split larger changes into smaller, related PRs
    - Break changes into logical commits that can be reviewed independently

2. **Code Quality**

    - Run `npm run lint` to check code style
    - Run `npm run format` to automatically format code
    - All PRs must pass CI checks which include both linting and formatting
    - Address any ESLint warnings or errors before submitting
    - Follow TypeScript best practices and maintain type safety

3. **Testing**

    - Add tests for new features
    - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
    - Update existing tests if your changes affect them
    - Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate

4. **Version Management with Changesets**

    - Create a changeset for any user-facing changes using `npm run changeset`
    - Choose the appropriate version bump:
        - `major` for breaking changes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
        - `minor` for new features (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
        - `patch` for bug fixes (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
    - Write clear, descriptive changeset messages that explain the impact
    - Documentation-only changes don't require changesets

5. **Commit Guidelines**

    - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
    - Use conventional commit format (e.g., "feat:", "fix:", "docs:")
    - Reference relevant issues in commits using #issue-number

6. **Before Submitting**

    - Rebase your branch on the latest main
    - Ensure your branch builds successfully
    - Double-check all tests are passing
    - Review your changes for any debugging code or console logs

7. **Pull Request Description**
    - Clearly describe what your changes do
    - Include steps to test the changes
    - List any breaking changes
    - Add screenshots for UI changes
