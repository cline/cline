This time, an operation of optimizing the prompt words with one click has been added. Most users, when using it, either enter incomplete content in the input box or enter content that the large model cannot understand.Now, a one-click prompt word optimization function has been added above the input box. When the button is clicked, the large model input by the user will be invoked to optimize the prompt words.In the future, some lightweight models can be considered to be directly integrated into this function.The button will only be displayed when there is content in the input box, and it will not be displayed when there is no content.
