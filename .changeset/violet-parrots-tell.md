Disable PostHog and build-time OpenTelemetry telemetry in self-hosted/on-premise mode. Enterprise customers running self-hosted deployments will no longer send any telemetry to Cline's collectors. Runtime environment OTEL and remote config OTEL remain available for enterprises to configure their own telemetry collection.
