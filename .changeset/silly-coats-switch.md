-   **Branch-Per-Task:** Each repo now has a single Shadow Git repo, with separate branches per task (instead of one Shadow Git repo per task).
-   **Legacy Support:** Existing Checkpoints remain functional, while all new Checkpoints use branch-per-task.

-   **Commits:** Legacy tasks commit to legacy Checkpoints; new tasks commit using branch-per-task.
-   **Diffing & Deletions:** Both legacy and branch-per-task Checkpoints support diffing and deletion.

No migration neededâ€”existing tasks stay as-is, and new tasks adopt **branch-per-task** automatically.
