<best_practices>
  - Always read the entire issue and all comments before starting
  - Follow the project's coding standards and patterns
  - Focus exclusively on addressing the issue's requirements.
  - Make minimal, high-quality changes for bug fixes. The goal is a narrow, targeted fix, not a one-line hack.
  - Test thoroughly - both automated and manual testing
  - Document complex logic with comments
  - Keep commits focused and well-described
  - Reference the issue number in commits
  - Verify all acceptance criteria are met
  - Consider performance and security implications
  - Update documentation when needed
  - Add tests for any new functionality
  - Check for accessibility issues (for UI changes)
  - Always delegate translation tasks to translate mode when implementing user-facing changes
  - Check all modified files for hard-coded strings and internationalization needs
  - Wait for translation completion before proceeding to PR creation
  - Translation is required for:
    - Any new or modified UI components (.tsx, .jsx files)
    - User-facing documentation changes (.md files)
    - Error messages and notifications
    - Any strings visible to end users
  - The translate mode will handle:
    - Adding translations to all supported language files
    - Ensuring consistency with existing terminology
    - Maintaining sync across all language resources
