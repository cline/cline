# How to Write Docs

1.  Create a new `.mdx` file in the `docs` directory.
2.  Add the new file to the `docs/docs.json` navigation.
3.  Run `cd docs && npm install && npm run dev` to start the Mintlify server.
4.  If the sidebar does not update, restart the server by stopping the current process and running `cd docs && npm run dev` again.
