The goal of this workflow is to take a changeset for a release of Cline, an autonomous coding agent extension that plugs right into your IDE, and write the updated announcement component, and the updated changelog. 


For reference, here are some examples of how we converted previous changesets to announcement components / changelogs.

We have a changeset PR that automatically generated as new unreleased PRs are merged into main, the PR is always called "Changeset version bump" and the author is github-actions. 

The Changeset PR description looks something like this:

</changeset-pr-description>

The changeset pr is ALWAYS on the following branch: `changeset-release/main`.

I have the `gh` command line tool set up and authenticated, so you have everything you need.

The first step is to get the full diff from the changeset PR to look at the changes that were automatically made to the `CHANGELOG.md` file. By default it will automatically add a new section to the changelog.md file with the new version. The problem with the automatically generated section is that it just takes the text that the developers threw into their changeset files for each corresponding PR, and they can be pretty vague and bad. Additionally there's some stuff that is totally irrelevant for the end user, like minor refactoring changes. So I manually typically go in and update this section to be a proper changelog that will show up in our patchnotes. You can look at how the rest of the file is done because those are all good examples of us updating this to use good language for the end user. We usually put new features up top (and the most exciting flagship features at the very top), and then bug fixes/improvements at the bottom. Having some basic organization to the ordering of the bullet points by content is nice. But use common sense. 

To handle this process effectively, do the following:

For each of the automatically generated bullet points in the Changelog.md, you should
1. Take the commit hash at the start of the bullet point, and use the `gh` command line tool find the PR that it was associated with. 
2. Use the `gh` command to get the PR title/description/discussion to understand the context surrounding the PR.
3. Use the `gh` command line tool to get the full PR diff to fully understand the changes made in the code.
4. Synthesize that knowledge to determine (a) whether or not this change is relevant to end users and (b) what the text & ordering of the line should be.  
5. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` accordingly 

Do this for every single item in the list from the autogenerated bullet points. We want to be diligent and have a full understanding of every feature so we can make the best changelog ever!

Here are some principles for good changelogs from keepchangelog.com, a handy guide:

<keepachangelog-pinciples-for-good-changelogs>
### Guiding Principles
- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- The latest version comes first.

### Bullet points in the changelog should follow these principles:
- Types of changes
- Added for new features.
- Changed for changes in existing functionality.
- Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features.
- Removed for now removed features.
- Fixed for any bug fixes.
- Security in case of vulnerabilities.
</keepachangelog-pinciples-for-good-changelogs>

Lastly, when developers make a PR, they typically make a changeset. And they have 3 options when making the changeset:

1. Patch
2. Minor
3. Major

Sometimes they label something as minor when really it should just be a patch. Or vice versa. Because of this, the automatic version bump may be incorrect. So when starting out this workflow, you should use the <ask_followup_question> tool to confirm with me whether or not this should be a patch bump (show the old version number and what the proposed new version number would be) or a minor bump. Part of the release process is making sure the version in package.json that is automatically changed actually corresponds with what we decided the bump should actually be based on the features. ALL these modifications happen in the `changeset-release/main` branch btw. 

<important_note>
Before doing any of this, make sure you check out the `changeset-release/main` and pull the most recent up to date changes. Then perform all this work in that branch. 

New announcement banners should ONLY be made for minor version bumps or higher. That's another reason why double checking if the changelog warrants the bump is important.

Also, SUPER important: For any external contributors that aren't part of the cline github organization, we always want to add a (Thanks @username!) at the end of the changelog to attribute them properly. We're an open source project and it's ethical to do this.
</important_note>

Once the changelog looks good, and the version number looks good, we gotta double check that the version number in the changelog has the brackets around it. And as a final step, double check the package.json version number matches the latest number in the changelog. And as the ultimate final step we run `npm run install:all` to make sure the package version number permiates through the lock file. 


<detailed_sequence_of_steps>
# Cline Release Process - Detailed Sequence of Steps

## Before Starting
1. First, examine the changeset PR without checking it out:
   ```bash
   gh pr view changeset-release/main
   ```

2. View the PR diff to see the auto-generated CHANGELOG.md changes:
   ```bash
   gh pr diff changeset-release/main > changeset-diff.txt
   cat changeset-diff.txt | grep -A 50 "CHANGELOG.md"
   ```

## Initial Setup
3. Once you're ready to start, checkout and update the changeset release branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout changeset-release/main
   git pull origin changeset-release/main
   ```

## Analyzing Each Change
4. For each commit hash in the auto-generated changelog entries:

   a. Find the PR number associated with a commit hash:
      ```bash
      gh pr list --search "<commit-hash>" --state merged
      ```
   
   b. Get PR details for better context:
      ```bash
      gh pr view <PR-number>
      ```
   
   c. Check if the contributor is external to determine if attribution is needed:
      ```bash
      # Extract username from PR
      USERNAME=$(gh pr view <PR-number> --json author --jq .author.login)
      
      # Check if user is a member of the Cline organization
	  # this command is a bit finnicky, but it 100% works. 
	  # if you see a `Error executing command: The command ran successfully, but we couldn't capture its output. Please proceed accordingly.` error, just retry it until you actually get the output
	  # don't make any assumptions, just retry the command to actually get the output and determine if they're external or not.
	  # no output means they are an external contributor, otherwise if there is output they are an internal contributor (part of our github org)
      gh api "orgs/cline/members" --jq "map(.login)" | grep -i "pashpashpash"
      ```
   
   d. View the full PR diff to understand code changes:
      ```bash
      gh pr diff <PR-number> > pr-diff-<PR-number>.txt
      cat pr-diff-<PR-number>.txt
      ```

## Updating the Changelog
5. Based on PR analysis, update the CHANGELOG.md with user-friendly descriptions:
   - Use the `<replace_in_file>` tool to edit the CHANGELOG.md file
   - Group by feature type (Added, Changed, Fixed)
   - Put most exciting features at the top
   - Move bug fixes and small improvements to the bottom
   - Use clear, end-user focused language
   - For external contributors, add attribution at the end of the relevant entry: `(Thanks @username!)`

## Version Number Verification
6. Confirm the version bump is appropriate:
   - Check package.json to verify the auto-generated version number:
     ```bash
     cat package.json | grep "\"version\""
     ```
   - If the feature set doesn't warrant a minor bump, use the `<replace_in_file>` tool to modify package.json

7. Ensure the version in CHANGELOG.md has brackets around it:
   ```
   ## [3.16.0]
   ```

## Creating the Announcement (for minor/major versions only)
8. If this is a minor version bump, create/update the announcement component:
   - Use the `<replace_in_file>` tool to edit the src/views/components/announcement.tsx file
   - Update the highlights based on key features
   - Move previous version highlights to the "Previous Updates" section
   - Use the previous announcement components as reference for structure

## Finalizing the Release
9. Update dependencies with the new version number:
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

10. Commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git add CHANGELOG.md package.json package-lock.json src/views/components/announcement.tsx
    git commit -m "Update CHANGELOG.md and announcement for version 3.16.0"
    ```

11. Push your changes to the changeset branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin changeset-release/main
    ```

12. Check that your changes pushed successfully:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
