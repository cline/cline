This file is the secret sauce for working effectively in this codebase. It captures tribal knowledge—the nuanced, non-obvious patterns that make the difference between a quick fix and hours of back-and-forth & human intervention.

**When to add to this file:**
- User had to intervene, correct, or hand-hold
- Multiple back-and-forth attempts were needed to get something working
- You discovered something that required reading many files to understand
- A change touched files you wouldn't have guessed
- Something worked differently than you expected
- User explicitly asks to "add this to CLAUDE.md"

**Proactively suggest additions** when any of the above happen—don't wait to be asked.

**What NOT to add:** Stuff you can figure out from reading a few files, obvious patterns, or standard practices. This file should be high-signal, not comprehensive.

## Miscellaneous
- Avoid provider-specific string matching / hardcoded provider branches when fixing provider/config plumbing. Prefer provider metadata, shared catalog/defaults, explicit protocol/client capabilities, or centralized normalization utilities that apply by data shape rather than `providerId === "..."`. If a provider exception seems necessary, stop and explain why instead of adding ad-hoc string matching.
- This is a VS Code extension—check `package.json` for available scripts before trying to verify builds (e.g., `npm run compile`, not `npm run build`).
- When creating PRs, contributors should not create changelog-entry files. Maintainers handle release versioning and changelog curation during the release process.
- When adding new feature flags, see this PR as a reference https://github.com/cline/cline/pull/7566

## Searching the Codebase — Avoiding Build Output

Several directories contain build output or generated code that produces
noisy or unusable results with `search_files` / `grep`:

| Directory | What it is | Why it's a problem |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| `out/` | esbuild bundle output | Mirrors `src/` structure as minified JS — every search gets duplicate hits on single-line files |
| `dist/` | Packaged extension | Entire extension bundled into one minified `extension.js` (~1 long line) |
| `dist-standalone/` | Standalone build output | Same minification issue |
| `src/generated/` | Generated protobuf code | Auto-generated from `proto/`; not the source of truth |
| `src/shared/proto/` | Generated proto type defs | Auto-generated from `proto/`; not the source of truth |
| `node_modules/` | Dependencies | Huge, not project source |

### How to skip build output

**`search_files`** — Point at `src/` (not the project root) and use `file_pattern`:
```
search_files(path="src/core", regex="myFunction", file_pattern="*.ts")
```
The `file_pattern` parameter is the most effective filter — e.g. `"*.ts"`,
`"*.tsx"`, `"*.proto"`.

**`grep` directly** — Exclude build dirs and restrict to source extensions:
```bash
grep -rn "myFunction" src/ --include="*.ts" --exclude-dir={out,dist,node_modules,generated}
```

### When you must search minified files

Sometimes you need to verify what got bundled (e.g., checking if a change
made it into the build). Minified files are typically one long line, so
normal `grep` shows the entire file as context. Use these approaches:

- **`grep -oP`** to extract just the match with limited surrounding context:
  ```bash
  grep -oP '.{0,40}myFunction.{0,40}' dist/extension.js
  ```
- **`read_file`** on files in `out/src/` — these have source maps and are
  more readable than `dist/extension.js` (which is the fully bundled output).
- **Source maps** — `out/src/*.js.map` and `dist/extension.js.map` can be
  used to trace minified output back to original source locations.

## gRPC/Protobuf Communication
The extension and webview communicate via gRPC-like protocol over VS Code message passing.

**Proto files live in `proto/`** (e.g., `proto/cline/task.proto`, `proto/cline/ui.proto`)
- Each feature domain has its own `.proto` file
- For simple data, use shared types in `proto/cline/common.proto` (`StringRequest`, `Empty`, `Int64Request`)
- For complex data, define custom messages in the feature's `.proto` file
- Naming: Services `PascalCaseService`, RPCs `camelCase`, Messages `PascalCase`
- For streaming responses, use `stream` keyword (see `subscribeToAuthCallback` in `account.proto`)

**Run `npm run protos`** after any proto changes—generates types in:
- `src/shared/proto/` - Shared type definitions
- `src/generated/grpc-js/` - Service implementations
- `src/generated/nice-grpc/` - Promise-based clients
- `src/generated/hosts/` - Generated handlers

**Adding new enum values** (like a new `ClineSay` type) requires updating conversion mappings in `src/shared/proto-conversions/cline-message.ts`

**Adding new RPC methods** requires:
- Handler in `src/core/controller/<domain>/`
- Call from webview via generated client: `UiServiceClient.scrollToSettings(StringRequest.create({ value: "browser" }))`

**Example—the `explain-changes` feature touched:**
- `proto/cline/task.proto` - Added `ExplainChangesRequest` message and `explainChanges` RPC
- `proto/cline/ui.proto` - Added `GENERATE_EXPLANATION = 29` to `ClineSay` enum
- `src/shared/ExtensionMessage.ts` - Added `ClineSayGenerateExplanation` type
- `src/shared/proto-conversions/cline-message.ts` - Added mapping for new say type
- `src/core/controller/task/explainChanges.ts` - Handler implementation
- `webview-ui/src/components/chat/ChatRow.tsx` - UI rendering

## Adding New Global State Keys
Adding a new key to global state requires updates in multiple places. Missing any step causes silent failures.

Required steps:
1. Type definition in `src/shared/storage/state-keys.ts` - Add to `GlobalState` or `Settings` interface
2. Read from globalState in `src/core/storage/utils/state-helpers.ts`:
   - Add `const myKey = context.globalState.get<GlobalStateAndSettings["myKey"]>("myKey")` in `readGlobalStateFromDisk()`
   - Add to the return object: `myKey: myKey ?? defaultValue,`
3. StateManager handles read/write via `setGlobalState()`/`getGlobalStateKey()` after initialization

Common mistake: Adding only the return value without the `context.globalState.get()` call. This compiles but the value is always `undefined` on load.

Settings plumbing gotcha: if a key is user-toggleable from settings, wire both controller update paths:
- `src/core/controller/state/updateSettings.ts` for webview `updateSetting(...)`
- `src/core/controller/state/updateSettingsCli.ts` for CLI/ACP settings updates
Missing one path causes a toggle to appear to change in one surface while the backend state stays unchanged.

Webview toggle gotcha: settings changes must also round-trip back in state payloads.
- Add the field to `UpdateSettingsRequest` in `proto/cline/state.proto` (for webview update requests), then run `npm run protos`
- Include the key in `Controller.getStateToPostToWebview()` (`src/core/controller/index.ts`)
- Ensure `ExtensionState` and webview defaults include the key (`src/shared/ExtensionMessage.ts`, `webview-ui/src/context/ExtensionStateContext.tsx`)
If this round-trip wiring is missing, the backend value can update but the toggle in webview appears stuck or reverts.

## StateManager Cache vs Direct globalState Access
StateManager uses an in-memory cache populated during `StateManager.initialize(context)` in `common.ts`. For most state, use `controller.stateManager.setGlobalState()`/`getGlobalStateKey()`.

Exception: State needed immediately at extension startup (before cache is ready)

When Window A sets state and immediately opens Window B, the new window's StateManager cache is populated from `context.globalState` during initialization. If you need to read state in Window B right at startup (e.g., in `common.ts` during `initialize()`), read directly from `context.globalState.get()` instead of StateManager's cache.

Example pattern (see `lastShownAnnouncementId` and `worktreeAutoOpenPath`):
```typescript
// Writing (normal pattern)
controller.stateManager.setGlobalState("myKey", value)

// Reading at startup in common.ts (bypass cache)
const value = context.globalState.get<string>("myKey")
```

This is only needed for cross-window state read during the brief startup window before StateManager cache is fully usable. Normal state access after initialization should use StateManager.

## ChatRow Cancelled/Interrupted States
When a ChatRow displays a loading/in-progress state (spinner), you must handle what happens when the task is cancelled. This is non-obvious because cancellation doesn't update the message content—you have to infer it from context.

**The pattern:**
1. A message has a `status` field (e.g., `"generating"`, `"complete"`, `"error"`) stored in `message.text` as JSON
2. When cancelled mid-operation, the status stays `"generating"` forever—no one updates it
3. To detect cancellation, check TWO conditions:
   - `!isLast` — if this message is no longer the last message, something else happened after it (interrupted)
   - `lastModifiedMessage?.ask === "resume_task" || "resume_completed_task"` — task was just cancelled and is waiting to resume

**Example from `generate_explanation`:**
```tsx
const wasCancelled =
    explanationInfo.status === "generating" &&
    (!isLast ||
        lastModifiedMessage?.ask === "resume_task" ||
        lastModifiedMessage?.ask === "resume_completed_task")
const isGenerating = explanationInfo.status === "generating" && !wasCancelled
```

**Why both checks?**
- `!isLast` catches: cancelled → resumed → did other stuff → this old message is stale
- `lastModifiedMessage?.ask === "resume_task"` catches: just cancelled, hasn't resumed yet, this message is still technically "last"

**See also:** `BrowserSessionRow.tsx` uses similar pattern with `isLastApiReqInterrupted` and `isLastMessageResume`.

**Backend side:** When streaming is cancelled, clean up properly (close tabs, clear comments, etc.) by checking `taskState.abort` after the streaming function returns.
