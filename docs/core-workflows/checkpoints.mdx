Checkpoints automatically save snapshots of your workspace after each step in a task. This lets you track changes, roll back when needed, and experiment confidently.

## How Checkpoints Work

Cline creates a checkpoint after each tool use (file edits, commands, etc.). These checkpoints:

- Work alongside your Git workflow without interference
- Maintain context between restores
- Use a shadow Git repository to track changes

If you're working on a feature and Cline makes multiple file changes, each change creates a checkpoint. You can review each modification and roll back to any point without affecting your main Git repository.

## Enabling or Disabling Checkpoints

Checkpoints are enabled by default. To toggle:

1. Open Cline settings (gear icon)
2. Go to "Feature Settings"
3. Toggle "Enable Checkpoints"

You might disable checkpoints for large repositories (additional storage), performance concerns, or simple low-risk tasks.

## Viewing Changes & Restoring

After each tool use:

1. Click "Compare" to see modified files
2. Click "Restore" to open restore options

## Restore Options

Click "Restore" next to any step and choose from three options:

| Option | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| Restore Task and Workspace | Reset both codebase and task to that point |
| Restore Task Only | Keep codebase changes but revert task context |
| Restore Workspace Only | Reset codebase while preserving task context |

If Cline makes changes you don't like while styling a component, use "Restore Workspace Only" to revert code while keeping the conversation. Then try a different approach.

## Use Cases

Checkpoints let you be more experimental with Cline. While human coding is often methodical and iterative, AI can make substantial changes quickly. Checkpoints help you track and revert if needed.

### With Auto-Approve

Checkpoints provide a safety net for rapid iterations. Makes it easy to undo unexpected results.

### Testing Different Approaches

- Try multiple solutions confidently
- Compare different implementations
- Quickly revert to working states
- Explore different design patterns

## Best Practices

1. Use checkpoints as safety nets when experimenting
2. Leverage [auto-approve](/customization/auto-approve) more confidently knowing you can roll back
3. Restore selectively:
   - "Restore Task and Workspace" for a fresh start
   - "Restore Task Only" to try different prompts but keep file changes
   - "Restore Workspace Only" to try different implementations while preserving conversation

## Relationship with Message Editing

The [message editing](/features/editing-messages) feature uses checkpoints when you select "Restore All." This lets you edit and resubmit your message while also restoring your workspace to that point in the conversation.

## Deleting Checkpoints

Delete all checkpoints with the "Delete All History" button in task history. This also deletes all tasks. Checkpoints are stored in VSCode's globalStorage.
