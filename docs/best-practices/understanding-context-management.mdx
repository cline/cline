## Understanding Context Management

Context management is crucial for effective AI-powered development with Cline. As you work on complex tasks, understanding how to optimize context usage ensures better performance, reduced costs, and more accurate responses.

## What is Context?

In AI systems, context refers to all the information the model can access when generating responses - including your conversation history, code files, terminal output, and system information. Every model has a maximum context window size that limits how much information it can process at once.

## Why Context Management Matters

### 1. Performance
- Larger context requires more processing time
- Optimized context leads to faster responses
- Focused context improves accuracy

### 2. Cost Efficiency  
- Most models charge based on tokens processed
- Unnecessary context increases costs
- Smart management reduces API expenses

### 3. Response Quality
- Relevant context improves understanding
- Too much noise can confuse the model
- Focused context yields better results

## Best Practices

### Keep Tasks Focused

Instead of one long conversation covering multiple topics:
- Start new tasks for different features or problems
- Use the "New Task" tool to preserve context while starting fresh
- Keep each task centered on a specific goal

### Use .clineignore Effectively

Create a `.clineignore` file to exclude:
- Build directories (`dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`)
- Large generated files
- Binary files and assets
