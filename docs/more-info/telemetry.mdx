### Overview

To help make Cline better for everyone, we collect anonymous usage data that helps us understand how developers are using our open-source AI coding agent. This feedback loop is crucial for improving Cline's capabilities and user experience.

We use PostHog, an open-source analytics platform, for data collection and analysis. Our telemetry implementation is fully transparent - you can review the [source code](https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/src/services/telemetry/TelemetryService.ts) to see exactly what we track.

### Tracking Policy

Privacy is our priority. All collected data is anonymized before being sent to PostHog, with no personally identifiable information (PII) included. Your code, prompts, and conversation content always remain private and are never collected.

### What We Track

We collect basic anonymous usage data including:

**Task Interactions:** When tasks start and finish, conversation flow (without content)\
**Mode and Tool Usage:** Switches between plan/act modes, which tools are being used\
**Token Usage:** Basic metrics about conversation length to estimate cost (not the actual content of the tokens)\
**System Context:** OS type and VS Code environment details\
**UI Activity:** Navigation patterns and feature usage

For complete transparency, you can inspect our [telemetry implementation](https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/src/services/telemetry/TelemetryService.ts) to see the exact events we track.

### How to Opt Out

Telemetry in Cline is entirely optional:

-   When you update or install our VS Code extension, you'll see a message about our anonymous telemetry
-   You can change your preference anytime in settings

Cline also respects VS Code's global telemetry settings. If you've disabled telemetry at the VS Code level, Cline's telemetry will automatically be disabled as well.
