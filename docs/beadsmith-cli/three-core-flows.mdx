description: "Learn the three ways to use Beadsmith CLI: interactive mode, headless automation, and multi-instance parallelization"
---

Two concepts to understand:

**Task** - A single job for Beadsmith to complete ("add tests to utils.js"). You describe what you want, Beadsmith plans how to do it, then executes the plan. Tasks run on instances.

**Instance** - An independent Beadsmith workspace. Each instance runs one task at a time. Create multiple instances to run multiple tasks that work on different parts of your project in parallel.

## 1. Interactive mode: Plan first, then act

Start here to see how Beadsmith works. Interactive mode opens a chat session where you can review plans before execution.

```bash
beadsmith
```

Beadsmith opens an interactive session in your current directory. Type your task as a message. Beadsmith enters Plan mode and proposes a step-by-step strategy.

Review or edit the plan in chat. When you're ready, switch to execution:

```bash
/act
```

Beadsmith executes the approved steps—reading files, writing code, running commands. You maintain control throughout the process.

## 2. Headless single-shot: Complete a task without chat

Use this for automation where you want a one-liner that just does the work.

```bash
beadsmith instance new --default
beadsmith task new -y "Generate unit tests for all Go files"
```

With the `-y` (YOLO) flag, Beadsmith plans and executes autonomously without interactive chat. Perfect for CI, cron jobs, or scripts.

Examples:

```bash
# Create a complete feature
beadsmith task new -y "Create a REST API for user authentication"

# Generate documentation
beadsmith task new -y "Add JSDoc comments to all functions in src/"

# Refactor code
beadsmith task new -y "Convert all var declarations to const/let"
```

Monitor your task with:

```bash
# View task status
beadsmith task view

# Follow task progress in real-time
beadsmith task view --follow
```

Press Ctrl+C to exit the view.

<Note>
Run YOLO mode with care on a directory or a clean Git branch. You get speed in exchange for oversight, so be ready to revert if needed.
</Note>

## 3. Multi-instance: Run parallel agents

Multiple instances let you parallelize work on the same project without colliding contexts. Run frontend, backend, and infrastructure tasks simultaneously.

Create your first instance:

```bash
beadsmith instance new
```

This returns an instance address you'll use to target tasks. Attach a task to this instance:

```bash
# Frontend work on first instance
beadsmith task new -y "Build React components"
```

Create a second instance and set it as default in one command:

```bash
beadsmith instance new --default
```

Now you can create tasks without specifying the address—they automatically use the default instance:

```bash
# Backend work on the new default instance
beadsmith task new -y "Implement API endpoints"
```

List all running instances:

```bash
beadsmith instances list
```

Stop all instances when done:

```bash
beadsmith instances kill -a
```

<Tip>
Keep track of instance addresses returned by `beadsmith instance new`. When scripting multiple agents, store these IDs and direct your tasks to the appropriate instance.
</Tip>

## Configuring context window for local providers

For Ollama and LM Studio, you can configure the model context window via CLI:

```bash
# For Ollama
beadsmith config s ollama-api-options-ctx-num=32768

# For LM Studio
beadsmith config s lm-studio-max-tokens=32768
```

For other providers (Anthropic, OpenRouter, etc.), the context window is defined per model in the model metadata and is not user-configurable—Beadsmith uses each model's built-in context limits automatically.

## Choosing the right flow

- **Interactive mode**: Best for exploring new problems, learning how Beadsmith works, or when you want to review plans before execution
- **Headless single-shot**: Perfect for automation, CI/CD, and tasks where you trust Beadsmith to execute without supervision
- **Multi-instance**: Use when you need to parallelize work or maintain separate contexts for different parts of your project
