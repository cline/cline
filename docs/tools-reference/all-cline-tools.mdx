Cline has access to a set of tools for various tasks. This reference covers all available tools and how to use them.

## What Can Cline Do?

- Edit and create files in your project
- Run terminal commands
- Search and analyze your code
- Help debug and fix issues
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Integrate with external tools via MCP

## File Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `write_to_file` | Create or overwrite files |
| `read_file` | Read file contents |
| `replace_in_file` | Make targeted edits to files |
| `search_files` | Search files using regex |
| `list_files` | List directory contents |
| `list_code_definition_names` | List code definitions in files |

### Examples

Create a new file:
```xml
<write_to_file>
<path>src/components/Header.tsx</path>
<content>
import React from "react"

interface HeaderProps {
  title: string
}

export default function Header({ title }: HeaderProps) {
  return (
    <header style={{ padding: "1rem", borderBottom: "1px solid #eee" }}>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
    </header>
  )
}
</content>
</write_to_file>
```

Search for a pattern:
```xml
<search_files>
<path>src</path>
<regex>function\s+\w+\(</regex>
<file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

## Terminal Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute_command` | Run CLI commands |

Run a command:
```xml
<execute_command>
<command>npm install axios</command>
<requires_approval>false</requires_approval>
</execute_command>
```

## Browser Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browser_action` | Interact with websites through Puppeteer |

See [Browser Automation](/tools-reference/browser-automation) for details.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `use_mcp_tool` | Use tools from MCP servers |
| `access_mcp_resource` | Access MCP server resources |

MCP tools extend Cline's capabilities through external integrations. See [MCP documentation](/mcp/mcp-overview) for details.

## Interaction Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ask_followup_question` | Ask user for clarification |
| `attempt_completion` | Present final results |

## New Task Tool

The `new_task` tool enables context management and task continuity. It packages current progress and context into a fresh task with a clean context window.

### When to Use

- Context window filling up but work isn't done
- Completing a logical subtask before starting the next
- After research phase, ready to implement

### How It Works

1. Cline proposes creating a new task with summarized context
2. You can refine the proposed context
3. Once approved, current task ends and new one begins with the context preloaded

### Using the /newtask Command

Type `/newtask` in chat to manually trigger this process. Cline will:
- Analyze the conversation
- Propose distilled context to carry forward
- Let you refine before creating the new task

This works like a developer handoff, packaging what matters (plan, work done, files, next steps) while leaving behind noise.

## Source Code
