### Other Things to Know

#### Working with Git & GitHub

Git helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others. Here are the essential commands you'll use:

**Daily Development**

```bash
# Save your changes (do this often!)
git add .                                    # Stage all changed files
git commit -m "Add login page"              # Save changes with a clear message

# Share your changes
git push origin main                        # Upload to GitHub
```

**Common Workflow**

1.  **Start of day**: Get latest changes

    ```bash
    bashCopygit pull origin main                     # Download latest code
    ```

2.  **During development**: Save work regularly

    ```bash
    bashCopygit add .
    git commit -m "Clear message about changes"
    ```

3.  **End of day**: Share your progress

    ```bash
    bashCopygit push origin main                     # Upload to GitHub
    ```

**Best Practices**

-   Commit often with clear messages
-   Pull before starting new work
-   Push completed work to share with others
-   Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive files

> **Tip**: Vercel automatically deploys when you push to main!

#### Environment Variables

-   Store secrets in `.env.local` for development
-   Add them to Vercel project settings for production
-   Never commit `.env` files to Git
