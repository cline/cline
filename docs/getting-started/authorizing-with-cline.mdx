Cline connects to AI models through a **provider**. You have two paths:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cline Provider" icon="bolt">
    Sign in with Google, GitHub, or email. No API keys to manage — access multiple models with built-in billing, free options, and early access to new releases.

    **Best for:** Most users, fastest setup
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)" icon="key">
    Use 3rd party provider or API keys from Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or any supported provider. Run models locally with Ollama or LM Studio for complete privacy.

    **Best for:** Enterprise, custom billing, local models
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  **Watch:** [Selecting Your Model](https://youtu.be/GuPmu5TVtfA) walks through choosing and configuring your first model.
</Tip>

## Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click the settings icon in the top-right of the Cline panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a Provider">
    Choose from the **API Provider** dropdown:
    - **Cline** — simplest setup, no API key needed
    - **OpenRouter** — many models, one API key
    - **Anthropic** — direct Claude access
    - **Ollama / LM Studio** — run models locally
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    **Cline Provider:** Click **Sign In** and authenticate via Google, GitHub, or email. See [OAuth details](#how-oauth-works) below.

    **BYOK:** Paste your API key from your provider's dashboard.

    **Local:** No key needed — just ensure your local server is running.

    <Note>
    API keys are stored in your system's credential manager and sent only to your selected provider. They are never logged or transmitted to Cline's servers.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a Model">
    Select a model from the **Model** dropdown. Consider:
    - **Context window** — how much code the model can process at once
    - **Speed** — smaller models respond faster
    - **Cost** — varies by model; local models are free
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify">
    Send any message. If Cline responds, you're ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cline Provider

The Cline Provider gives you one account, one billing relationship, and access to models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and more.

- **No API key juggling** — one sign-in, multiple models
- **Built-in billing** — add credits once, use across all models
- **Free models** — search "free" in the model selector to find no-cost options tagged **FREE**
- **Stealth models** — early access to new releases before they're widely available
- **Always current** — new models added as they launch

### Adding Credits

Click **Add Credits** in Cline settings or visit your [account dashboard](https://app.cline.bot/dashboard). Credits work across all available models.

### How OAuth Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign In">
    Click **Sign In** in Cline settings. Your browser opens to `app.cline.bot`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Choose Google, GitHub, or email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return to IDE">
    After authentication, you're redirected back with an authorization code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure Storage">
    Tokens are stored in your IDE's native secret storage (VS Code Secrets, JetBrains Credential Store, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Use your own API keys when you need specific billing arrangements, higher rate limits, access to beta models, or local privacy.

### Cloud Providers

| Provider | Best For | Setup Guide |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **OpenRouter** | Multiple models, competitive pricing | [Setup](/provider-config/openrouter) |
| **Anthropic** | Direct Claude access | [Setup](/provider-config/anthropic) |
| **Claude Code** | Claude Max/Pro subscription | [Setup](/provider-config/claude-code) |
| **OpenAI** | GPT models | [Setup](/provider-config/openai) |
| **Google Gemini** | Large context windows | [Setup](/provider-config/gcp-vertex-ai) |
| **AWS Bedrock** | Enterprise | [Setup](/provider-config/aws-bedrock/api-key) |
| **DeepSeek** | Great value | [Setup](/provider-config/deepseek) |

### Local Models

Run models on your own hardware for complete privacy and zero per-request costs.

| Provider | Best For | Setup Guide |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Ollama** | Easy setup, wide model selection | [Setup](/running-models-locally/ollama) |
| **LM Studio** | GUI-based model management | [Setup](/running-models-locally/lm-studio) |

Local models require sufficient hardware (especially GPU memory). See [Running Models Locally](/running-models-locally/overview) for requirements.

## Which Model Should I Choose?

| Priority | Recommended Model |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Reliability** | Claude Sonnet 4 |
| **Value** | Qwen3 Coder |
| **Speed** | Cerebras GLm 4.6 |
| **Privacy** | Any Ollama/LM Studio model |
| **Existing subscription** | Claude Code with Max/Pro |

## CLI Authentication

```bash
# Authenticate from the terminal
cline auth

# Shorthand
cline a
```

Opens a browser for OAuth, same as the IDE extension. Your session persists until you sign out.

## Account Management

- **Balance & usage:** Open Cline settings — your credit balance is at the top. Click **View Usage** for transaction history.
- **Switch organization:** Go to Cline settings → **Switch Organization** to change which billing account is charged.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "Unauthorized: Please sign in" | Session expired. Click **Sign In** to re-authenticate. |
| Browser doesn't open | Check default browser settings. Copy the URL from the Cline output panel manually. |
| Frequent re-authentication | Check org security policies. Ensure you're not clearing IDE secrets. Try a full sign-out/sign-in. |
| Can't access organization | Verify membership at [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot). Ask your admin about permissions. Sign out and back in. |
