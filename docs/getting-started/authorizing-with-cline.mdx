# Authorization

Cline requires authentication to access AI models. You have two options: use the **Cline Provider** for a seamless experience with built-in billing, or configure your own API keys from third-party providers.

<Tip>
  **You don't need a Cline account to use Cline.** You can configure any provider with your own API keys. However, a Cline account is **highly recommended** for the simplest setup and best experience.
</Tip>

## Two Ways to Authenticate

| Method | Best For | Setup |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Cline Provider (OAuth)** | Most users | Sign in with Google, GitHub, or email |
| **Your Own API Keys** | Enterprise/power users | Configure keys from OpenRouter, Anthropic, etc. |

## Cline Provider (Recommended)

The Cline Provider is the easiest way to get started. It handles all API key management and billing through a single account, so you can focus on coding instead of managing multiple provider accounts and API keys.

When you use the Cline Provider, you get instant access to a curated selection of high-quality AI models from leading providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and more. Instead of signing up for multiple services, verifying your identity on each platform, and managing separate billing relationships, you can access everything through one simple integration.

The Cline Provider is designed for developers who want a streamlined experience. Your usage is tracked in real-time, and you can monitor your spending directly from the Cline interface. Whether you are experimenting with AI assistance for the first time or you are a power user who needs reliable access to the best models, the Cline Provider scales with your needs.

### Benefits

- **No API key juggling**: You don't need to create accounts with Anthropic, OpenAI, or other providers individually
- **Access to multiple models**: Switch between Claude, GPT, and other models without configuring separate providers
- **Built-in billing**: Add credits once and use them across any available model
- **Free options available**: Some models are completely free to use for learning and experimentation
- **Stealth models**: Get early access to the latest models before they're widely available, keeping you on the cutting edge
- **Always up to date**: The Cline Provider continuously adds new models as they're released, so you never have to wait to try the latest AI capabilities

### How OAuth Authentication Works

When you sign in with the Cline Provider, we use a secure OAuth flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate Sign-In">
    Click the **Settings** button in the top right of the Cline extension panel, then click **Sign In**. This opens your browser to `app.cline.bot`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Choose your preferred OAuth provider (Google, GitHub, or email) and complete authentication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorization Code">
    After successful authentication, you're redirected back to your IDE with an authorization code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Token Exchange">
    Cline exchanges the authorization code for access and refresh tokens.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure Storage">
    Tokens are stored securely in your IDE's native secret storage (VS Code Secrets, JetBrains Credential Store, etc.).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Finding Free Models

Search "free" in the model selector to find no-cost options. Free models display a **FREE** tag, and some include `:free` in their model name. These are great for learning Cline's capabilities before committing to paid usage.

### Adding Credits

When you're ready to use paid models, click the **Add Credits** button in the Cline settings or visit your [account dashboard](https://app.cline.bot/dashboard). Credits work across all models available through the Cline provider.

## CLI Authentication

For Cline CLI users, authentication is handled through the `cline auth` command:

```bash
# Start the authentication wizard
cline auth

# Or use the shorthand
cline a
```

This opens a browser for OAuth authentication, similar to the IDE extension. Once authenticated, your session remains active until you sign out with `cline auth` → "Sign Out".

## Using Your Own API Keys

If you prefer managing your own API keys or your organization requires specific billing arrangements, you can configure any supported provider directly.

### Supported Providers

| Provider | Best For | Setup Guide |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **OpenRouter** | Multiple models, competitive pricing | [OpenRouter Setup](/provider-config/openrouter) |
| **Anthropic** | Direct Claude access | [Anthropic Setup](/provider-config/anthropic) |
| **OpenAI** | GPT models | [OpenAI Setup](/provider-config/openai) |
| **Google Gemini** | Large context windows | [Gemini Setup](/provider-config/gcp-vertex-ai) |
| **AWS Bedrock** | Enterprise | [Bedrock Setup](/provider-config/aws-bedrock/api-key) |

### When to Use Your Own API Keys

You might prefer managing your own API keys if:

- Your organization requires specific billing arrangements
- You need higher rate limits than aggregated providers offer
- You want access to beta features or models not yet available through Cline
- You're running models locally for privacy or cost reasons

### Security Note

API keys are stored securely in your system's credential manager. Cline never sends your keys anywhere except directly to the provider you've selected. Keys are never logged or transmitted to Cline's servers.

## Account Management

### Viewing Your Balance and Usage

When authenticated with the Cline Provider:

1. Open Cline settings
2. Your current credit balance is displayed at the top
3. Click **View Usage** to see detailed transaction history

### Switching Organizations

If you belong to multiple organizations:

1. Go to Cline settings
2. Click **Switch Organization**
3. Select the organization to use for billing

Your active organization determines which billing account is charged for usage.

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized: Please sign in to Cline before trying again"

This error means your session has expired or is invalid. Click **Sign In** again to re-authenticate.

### Browser Doesn't Open

If the authentication browser doesn't open automatically:

1. Check your default browser settings
2. Look for a URL in the Cline output panel
3. Copy and paste the URL manually into your browser

### Session Expires Unexpectedly

If you're frequently asked to re-authenticate:

- Check if your organization has security policies that require frequent re-auth
- Ensure you're not clearing IDE secrets/cookies
- Try signing out completely and signing back in

### Can't Access Organization

If you can't see or switch to an organization:

- Verify you're a member of the organization in [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot)
- Check with your organization admin that you have the correct permissions
- Try signing out and back in to refresh your organization list

### CLI Auth Issues

For CLI-specific authentication problems:

```bash
# Check authentication status
cline auth status

# Force re-authentication
cline auth --force

# Sign out completely
cline auth logout
```

## Next Steps

Now that you're authenticated:

- [Select your first model](/getting-started/selecting-your-model) to start coding with AI
- Learn about [Cline's core workflows](/core-workflows/task-management)
- Explore [customization options](/customization/overview) to tailor Cline to your workflow
