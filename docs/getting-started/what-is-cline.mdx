Cline is an open-source AI coding agent that runs in your editor. It gives you direct, transparent access to frontier AI with no limits, no surprises, and no model ecosystem lock-in. See every decision. Choose any model. Control your costs.

## What Cline Can Do

Cline operates directly in your codebase with your permission:

- **Read and write files** - Navigate your codebase, create new files, and make targeted edits. You approve every change before it happens.
- **Run terminal commands** - Execute shell commands, run tests, install packages, and debug errors in real-time.
- **Use a browser** - Launch a browser to test web apps, capture screenshots, and interact with pages.
- **Connect external tools** - Extend capabilities with [MCP servers](/mcp/mcp-overview) for databases, APIs, and documentation.
- **Run from the command line** - Use the [Cline CLI](/cline-cli/getting-started) for headless automation, CI/CD pipelines, and shell workflows.

## Core Workflows

These are the patterns you'll use daily with Cline:

| Workflow | What It Does |
|----------|--------------|
| [Plan & Act](/core-workflows/plan-and-act) | Think first, then build. Plan mode explores your codebase without making changes. Act mode implements the solution. |
| [Task Management](/core-workflows/task-management) | Start tasks, resume previous work, and manage long-running sessions. |
| [Working with Files](/core-workflows/working-with-files) | Use @ mentions to reference files, folders, URLs, and terminal output in your prompts. |
| [Commands](/core-workflows/using-commands) | Keyboard shortcuts, slash commands, and terminal integration. |
| [Checkpoints](/core-workflows/checkpoints) | Automatic snapshots of your project. Restore to any previous state instantly. |

## Why Cline

- **Transparent by default** - Watch every file read, every decision considered, every token used. No black box.
- **Any model, any provider** - Use Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek, or local models. Switch instantly as new models launch.
- **Zero trust architecture** - Your code never touches our servers. Cline runs entirely client-side with your API keys.
- **Open source** - Every line of code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cline/cline). 50k+ stars from developers who use it daily.
