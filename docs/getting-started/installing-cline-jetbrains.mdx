Cline for JetBrains works almost identically to Cline in VSCode. All the core features work properly: diff editing, using tools, logging in with different providers, MCP servers, Cline rules and workflows, and more.

</details>

## Getting Started with Cline

After installation, you'll find Cline in your IDE. Look for the Cline tool window (usually on the right side) or go to **View** → **Tool Windows** → **Cline**.

Sign in is optional - you can also bring your own API key. If you want to sign in, click **Sign In** in the Cline panel. You'll be taken to [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot) to create your account. No credit card needed to get started with free credits.

Try this first prompt: "Hey Cline! Can you help me create a simple Hello World program in this project?"

## Key Differences from VSCode

The terminal integration works differently in JetBrains. Unlike VSCode where terminal output streams directly to the chat, JetBrains shows command output in a collapsible section. Commands still execute successfully - you just need to expand the **Command Output** section to see results.

## What Works

Everything else works exactly like VSCode. Cline can read, write, and edit files with the same precision. All his tools work identically - file operations, web browsing, you name it. 

You get full support for:
- API providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, local models)
- MCP servers and custom tools
- Cline rules and workflows
- @ mentions for files, folders, and problems
- Drag & drop for files and images

## Tips for JetBrains Users

Cline automatically understands your project structure, just like in VSCode. He works with any language your JetBrains IDE supports - Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, whatever you're building.

I find it helpful to share error messages and stack traces directly in the chat when debugging. You can also ask him to review your code changes before committing.

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Installation Issues

If you can't find Cline in the marketplace:
- Make sure you're searching in the **Marketplace** tab (not Installed)
- Try searching for "Cline AI" or just "Cline"
- Check that your IDE version is compatible (2023.1 or later recommended)

If installation fails:
- Restart your IDE and try again
- Check your internet connection
- Try installing from disk as an alternative

### Plugin Not Appearing

If you don't see the Cline tool window after installation:
- Restart your IDE completely (File → Exit and reopen)
- Check **View** → **Tool Windows** → **Cline**
- Verify the plugin is enabled in **Settings** → **Plugins** → **Installed** tab
- Look for the Cline icon in your IDE's tool window bar (usually on the right side)

### Common Issues

**Plugin appears to be installed but doesn't work:**
- Ensure you've restarted your IDE after installation
- Check if there are any error messages in the IDE's event log
- Try disabling and re-enabling the plugin in Settings

**Performance or compatibility issues:**
- Make sure you're using a supported JetBrains IDE version
- Check for IDE updates that might improve compatibility
- Consider allocating more memory to your IDE if needed
