## Current Top Programming Models

For the most up-to-date rankings, check [OpenRouter's Cline Leaderboard](https://openrouter.ai/apps?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcline.bot%2F) which shows real usage data from developers.

**Current top performers (as of May 2025):**

| Model                    | Input Cost\* | Output Cost\* | Context Window | Best For                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Claude Sonnet 4          | $3.00        | $15.00        | 200K           | Best overall code quality & tool use |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview   | $1.25        | $10.00        | 1.05M          | Large codebases, strong debugging    |
| GPT-4.1                  | $2.00        | $8.00         | 1.05M          | Software engineering & architecture  |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview | $0.15        | $0.60         | 1.05M          | Fast iteration, cost-effective       |

## Key Factors to Consider

### Performance

-   **Code Quality**: How accurate and maintainable is the generated code?
-   **Tool Usage**: How reliably does the model use Cline's tools (file editing, terminal, browser)?
-   **Problem Solving**: Can it handle complex, multi-step coding tasks?

**Tip**: Claude models generally have the best tool usage reliability, while DeepSeek offers great performance for the price.

### Context Windows

Think of this as the AI's "working memory" - how much information it can process at once.

-   **Short tasks & small files**: 128K+ tokens is sufficient
-   **Long tasks & large files**: 200K+ tokens recommended

**Real impact**: Larger context windows let you work with bigger files and have longer conversations without losing context. The AI can remember more of your task history and file contents.

### Cost

Models range from $0.15 to $15 per million output tokens. For typical daily coding:

-   **Budget option**: $2-5/month (DeepSeek, Gemini Flash)
-   **Premium option**: $15-40/month (Claude, Gemini Pro GPT-4.1)

**Cost tip**: Start with a budget model and upgrade if you need better quality or reliability.

## Understanding Context Windows

Context windows are measured in tokens (roughly 3/4 of a word). When you reach the limit, older conversation history gets removed to make room for new information.

Cline shows your context usage with a progress bar:

-   Input tokens (your messages and code)
-   Output tokens (AI responses)
-   Visual indicator of remaining capacity

## Quick Recommendations

**Just getting started?** Try **DeepSeek V3** - great performance at a low cost.

**Professional development?** Use **Claude Sonnet 4** - most reliable for production code.

**Large codebase?** Go with **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - massive context window handles complex projects.

**Tight budget?** **Gemini 2.5 Flash** offers solid performance for free/low cost.

## A Note on Local Models

We don't recommend local models for Cline. [Local models are significantly less reliable](https://docs.cline.bot/running-models-locally/read-me-first) at using tools and typically retain only 1-26% of the original model's capabilities. Cloud models provide much better reliability and performance.
