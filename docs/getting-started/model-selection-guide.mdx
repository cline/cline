New models drop constantly, so this guide focuses on what's working well with Cline right now. We'll keep it updated as the landscape shifts.

## Current Top Models

| Model | Context Window | Input Price* | Output Price* | Best For |
|-------|---------------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| **Claude Sonnet 4** | 1M tokens | $3-6 | $15-22.50 | Reliable tool usage, complex codebases |
| **Qwen3 Coder** | 256K tokens | $0.20 | $0.80 | Coding tasks, open source flexibility |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | 1M+ tokens | TBD | TBD | Large codebases, document analysis |
| **GPT-5** | 400K tokens | $1.25 | $10 | Latest OpenAI tech, three modes |

*Per million tokens

## Budget Options

| Model | Context Window | Input Price* | Output Price* | Notes |
|-------|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **DeepSeek V3** | 128K tokens | $0.14 | $0.28 | Great value for daily coding |
| **DeepSeek R1** | 128K tokens | $0.55 | $2.19 | Budget reasoning champion |
| **Qwen3 32B** | 128K tokens | Varies | Varies | Open source, multiple providers |
| **Z AI GLM 4.5** | 128K tokens | TBD | TBD | MIT licensed, hybrid reasoning |

*Per million tokens


## Context Window Guide

| Size | Word Count | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| 32K tokens | ~24,000 words | Single files, small projects |
| 128K tokens | ~96,000 words | Most coding projects |
| 200K tokens | ~150,000 words | Large codebases |
| 400K+ tokens | ~300,000+ words | Entire applications |

**Performance note**: Most models start dropping in quality around 400-500K tokens, even if they claim higher limits.

## Open Source vs Closed Source

### Open Source Advantages
- **Multiple providers** compete to host them
- **Cheaper pricing** due to competition  
- **Provider choice** - switch if one goes down
- **Faster innovation** cycles

### Open Source Models Available
- **Qwen3 Coder** (Apache 2.0)
- **Z AI GLM 4.5** (MIT)
- **Kimi K2** (Open source)
- **DeepSeek series** (Various licenses)

## Quick Decision Matrix

| If you want... | Use this |
|----------------|----------|
| Something that just works | Claude Sonnet 4 |
| To save money | DeepSeek V3 or Qwen3 variants |
| Huge context windows | Gemini 2.5 Pro or Claude Sonnet 4 |
| Open source | Qwen3 Coder, Z AI GLM 4.5, or Kimi K2 |
| Latest tech | GPT-5 |
| Speed | Qwen3 Coder on Cerebras (fastest available) |

## What Others Are Using

Check [OpenRouter's Cline usage stats](https://openrouter.ai/apps?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcline.bot%2F) to see real usage patterns from the community.

## Context Management

Cline automatically handles context limits with [auto-compact](/features/auto-compact). When you approach your model's limit, Cline summarizes the conversation to keep working. You don't need to micromanage this.

## The Bottom Line

Start with **Claude Sonnet 4** if you want reliability. Experiment with **open source options** once you're comfortable to find the best fit for your workflow and budget.

The landscape moves fast - these recommendations reflect what's working now, but keep an eye on new releases.
