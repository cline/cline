## Before You Begin

1. **Create your account** at [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot/login) for access to multiple AI models, seamless setup without managing API keys, and occasional free inferencing.

2. **Choose your platform**: VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains IDEs, CLI (macOS/Linux preview), Zed, Neovim, VSCodium, or Windsurf.

## Installation Instructions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VS Code/Cursor">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open VS Code or Cursor">
        Launch the editor on your computer.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open Extensions">
        Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + X` or click the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar.

      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Tip>
    If VS Code shows "Running extensions might..." dialog, click **Allow**. If you don't see the Cline icon, restart VS Code.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="JetBrains IDEs">
    <Note>
    Cline for JetBrains works almost identically to VS Code, with all core features: diff editing, tools, multiple API providers, MCP servers, Cline rules/workflows, and more.
    </Note>

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open your JetBrains IDE">
        Launch IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, or any JetBrains IDE.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open Settings">
        Press `Ctrl+Alt+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+,` (macOS).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Navigate to Plugins">
        Go to **Plugins** → **Marketplace** tab.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Install Cline">
        Search for "Cline" and click **Install**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Restart IDE">

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Alternative Installation Methods">
        **Browser Install:**
        1. Go to the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28247-cline)
        2. Click **Install to IDE**
        3. Confirm in your IDE and restart

        **Manual Install:**
        1. Download from the [marketplace page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28247-cline)
        2. Go to **Settings** → **Plugins** → gear icon → **Install Plugin from Disk**
        3. Select the downloaded `.zip` file and restart
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Terminal Integration Difference">
        JetBrains shows terminal output differently than VS Code. In VS Code, output streams directly to chat. In JetBrains, output appears in collapsible "Command Output" sections.
        
        Commands execute successfully in both. Expand the section to see results in JetBrains.

      </Step>
      <Step title="Run Cline">
        Run `cline` to start an interactive session, or `cline "Your task here"` for headless execution.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

## Setting Up Cline in the Right Sidebar

For the best coding experience, we recommend moving Cline to the right sidebar. This keeps your project files visible on the left while you chat with Cline on the right, giving you full visibility of your codebase as Cline works.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VS Code">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Align Extension View">
        Make sure your extension view is aligned vertically to the left.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open Right Side View">
        Click the button that opens the right side panel (typically used for GitHub Copilot chat), or use `Option + Cmd/Ctrl + B`.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Drag Cline Icon">
        Drag the Cline icon over to the nav panel at the top of that right view.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

        alt="VS Code Right Sidebar Setup"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cursor">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Set Vertical Activity Bar">
        Cursor uses a horizontal activity bar by default. To switch to vertical:
        1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
        2. Search for "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)"
        3. Search for `workbench.activityBar.orientation`
        4. Set the value to `vertical`
        5. Restart Cursor
      </Step>
      <Step title="Open the AI Pane">
        Click the Cursor cube icon (AI Pane) to open the right side view panel.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Drag Cline to the AI Pane">
        Drag the Cline icon directly into the AI Pane sidebar.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Frame>
      <img
        src="https://storage.googleapis.com/cline_public_images/Cursor-sidebar.gif"

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find Cline in the Marketplace

Sometimes Cline doesn't show up in search results if you're looking in the wrong tab or using an incompatible IDE version. Make sure you're searching in the **Marketplace** tab (not Installed), try searching for "Cline AI" instead, and verify your IDE is up to date. If installation fails, restart your IDE and check your internet connection.

### Cline Icon Not Appearing After Install

The most common fix is a full restart-close your IDE completely (File → Exit) and reopen it. In VS Code/Cursor/VSCodium, you can also open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`) and type "Cline: Open In New Tab". In JetBrains, check **View** → **Tool Windows** → **Cline**. If it's still missing, verify the plugin is enabled in your Extensions/Plugins settings.

### CLI: Node.js or Permission Errors

Cline CLI requires Node.js 20 or higher. Run `node --version` to check-if you need to upgrade, use nvm (`nvm install 22 && nvm use 22`) or download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). For permission errors on `npm install -g`, either prefix with `sudo` on macOS/Linux or configure npm to use a user-owned directory for global packages.

### Plugin Installed But Not Working

If Cline appears installed but doesn't respond, try disabling and re-enabling the extension in your IDE's settings. Check the Developer Console (VS Code: Help → Toggle Developer Tools) or Event Log (JetBrains) for error messages. Also ensure you're using a supported IDE version and close any resource-intensive extensions that might interfere.
