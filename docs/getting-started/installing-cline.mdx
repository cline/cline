Before installing Cline, make sure you have the following:

### Create a Cline Account

### Compatible Editor

Cline works with the following IDEs:

- **JetBrains IDEs** - IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, DataSpell, PhpStorm, and other JetBrains products
- **VSCodium** - Open-source version of VS Code

Make sure you have one of these editors installed before proceeding with the Cline installation.

    Cline for JetBrains works almost identically to Cline in VSCode. All the core features work properly: diff editing, using tools, logging in with different providers, MCP servers, Cline rules and workflows, and more.


    ### Installation Steps

    **Method 1: From IDE (Recommended)**
    1. Open your JetBrains IDE
    2. Go to **Settings** (`Ctrl+Alt+S` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+,` on macOS)
    3. Navigate to **Plugins** → **Marketplace**
    4. Search for "Cline" and click **Install**
    5. Restart your IDE

    **Method 2: Browser Install**
    
    Visit the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28247-cline) and click **Install to IDE**.

    <Accordion title="Method 3: Manual Installation">

    1. Download the plugin from the [marketplace page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/28247-cline)
    2. Go to **Settings** → **Plugins**
    3. Click the gear icon → **Install Plugin from Disk**
    4. Select the downloaded `.zip` file
    5. Restart your IDE

    </Accordion>

    ### Using the Plugin

    After installation, you’ll find Cline in your IDE. Look for the Cline tool window (usually on the right side) or go to View → Tool Windows → Cline.

    ### Key Features

    Cline for JetBrains includes all core features:
    - Diff editing and file modifications
    - Multiple API providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, local models)
    - MCP servers and custom tools
    - Cline rules and workflows
    - @ mentions for files, folders, and problems
    - Drag & drop support

    > **Note:** Terminal output appears in collapsible sections rather than streaming directly to chat.

    ### Key Differences from VSCode
    The terminal integration works differently in JetBrains. Unlike VSCode where terminal output streams directly to the chat, JetBrains shows command output in a collapsible section. Commands still execute successfully - you just need to expand the Command Output section to see results.
