### Getting Started

Before you jump into coding, make sure you have these essentials ready:

#### 1. **VS Code**

A popular, free, and powerful code editor.

> **Pro Tip:** Install VS Code in your Applications folder (macOS) or Program Files (Windows) for easy access from your dock or start menu.

#### 2. **Organize Your Projects**

Create a dedicated folder named `Cline` in your Documents folder for all your coding projects:

-   **macOS:** `/Users/[your-username]/Documents/Cline`
-   **Windows:** `C:\Users\[your-username]\Documents\Cline`

Inside your `Cline` folder, structure projects clearly:

-   `Documents/Cline/workout-app` _(e.g., for a fitness tracking app)_
-   `Documents/Cline/portfolio-website` _(e.g., to showcase your work)_

> **Tip:** Keeping your projects organized from the start will save you time and confusion later!

#### 3. **Install the Cline VS Code Extension**
