This tutorial walks you through building a todo app with Cline. Along the way, you'll learn how to give tasks, approve changes, iterate on your work, and recover from mistakes.

## Prerequisites

- Cline installed in your editor ([Install Guide](/getting-started/installing-cline))
- AI model connected ([Model Setup](/getting-started/authorizing-with-cline))
- Any folder open in your editor (empty folder works best)

## Give Cline a Task

Click the Cline icon in your editor's sidebar to open the chat panel. Paste this prompt:

```text
Build a todo app in a single HTML file. Include:
- Input field to add new tasks
- List that displays all tasks
- Checkbox to mark tasks complete (with strikethrough styling)
- Button to delete individual tasks
- Clean, modern design with CSS
- All JavaScript inline in the same file
```

Press Enter and watch Cline analyze your request.

<Tip>
Use `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) and search "Cline: Open In New Tab" to give Cline more screen space.
</Tip>

### Discuss Your Plan with Cline

Cline may start in **Plan mode**, where it analyzes your request and discusses the approach without making any changes yet. This is a great opportunity to have a conversation:

- Ask questions about the implementation
- Clarify requirements
- Discuss alternative approaches
- Refine the plan together

Once you're happy with the plan, **click the Act button** in the bottom right of the Cline panel to switch to Act mode. Cline will now start creating files and writing code.

<Note>
For simple tasks, you can start directly in Act mode. Use Plan mode when you want to think through a problem before committing to an approach. Learn more in the [Plan and Act guide](/core-workflows/plan-and-act).
</Note>

### Approve or Reject Changes

Cline asks permission before modifying your project. When it wants to create or edit a file, you'll see a diff preview showing exactly what will change.

- Click **Approve** to let Cline proceed
- Click **Reject** to stop and provide different instructions

This approval step keeps you in control. Every file creation, edit, and terminal command requires your explicit permission.

<Note>
Once you're comfortable with Cline, you can enable [auto-approve](/customization/auto-approve) to skip confirmations for specific actions.
</Note>

### Watch Cline Work

After approval, Cline creates your files. You'll see:

- File diffs showing each change
- Token usage tracking your API costs
- A summary when the task completes

For this todo app, Cline creates a single `index.html` file with HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic.

## View Your Todo App

Open the file to see your app in action:

**Option 1: Terminal command**
```bash
open index.html
```

**Option 2: File explorer**
Find `index.html` in your editor's file explorer, right-click, and select "Reveal in Finder" (Mac) or "Reveal in File Explorer" (Windows). Double-click to open in your browser.

**Option 3: Live Server**
If you have the Live Server extension, right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" for auto-refresh on changes.

Try adding a few tasks, marking them complete, and deleting them. The app works entirely in your browser with no backend required.

## Iterate on Your Project

Cline remembers your conversation context. In the same chat, try follow-up requests:

```text
Add local storage so tasks persist when I refresh the page
```

Or change the design:

```text
Switch to a dark theme with purple accent colors
```

Or add features:

```text
Add a filter to show all, active, or completed tasks
```

Each request builds on the existing code. Cline reads your current files, understands the structure, and makes targeted changes.

## Undo Mistakes with Checkpoints

Cline automatically saves checkpoints after each change. If something breaks or you don't like a modification, you can restore to any previous state.

Look for the **Compare** and **Restore** buttons next to each step in your conversation:

- **Compare** shows what files changed at that step
- **Restore** lets you roll back your project

When restoring, you have three options:

| Option | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| Restore Task and Workspace | Resets both your files and conversation to that point |
| Restore Task Only | Keeps file changes but reverts conversation context |
| Restore Workspace Only | Resets files but keeps conversation context |

Use "Restore Workspace Only" when you want to try a different approach without losing the conversation context.

<Tip>
Checkpoints work independently from Git. Your commits and branches stay untouched.
</Tip>

Learn more in the [Checkpoints guide](/core-workflows/checkpoints).

## What You Learned

You built a functional todo app and learned the core Cline workflow: describe what you want, approve the changes, and iterate with follow-up requests. You also discovered checkpoints for undoing mistakes and Plan/Act modes for tackling complex problems.

These patterns scale from simple scripts to large applications. The more context you give Cline about your project, the better results you'll get.
