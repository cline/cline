---

Ponder is an AI writing assistant which integrates with Microsoft Visual Studio Code, transforming it into a comprehensive creative writing studio. It provides an interface between your IDE and LLMs, facilitating creative writing, content creation, and literary composition, increasing productivity and lowering the barrier to entry for new writers. Depending on permissions, Ponder can read/write documents, execute research commands, use your web browser for fact-checking, and expand its capabilities with Model Context Protocol servers.

What makes Ponder distinctive is its thoughtful approach to creative writing and its extensive integration capabilities. Rather than simply generating text snippets, Ponder collaborates with writers by planning creative solutions step-by-step, maintaining awareness of the entire writing project, and requiring explicit approval for all changes. It can understand large manuscripts, accelerate onboarding for new writers, and connect with hundreds of writing tools through its Model Context Protocol Marketplace, enabling everything from character database management to automated research gatheringâ€”all through natural language commands.
