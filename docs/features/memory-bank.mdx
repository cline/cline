description: "A structured documentation system that helps Cline maintain context across sessions."
---

Memory Bank is a documentation methodology that transforms Cline from a stateless assistant into a persistent development partner. Through structured markdown files, Cline can "remember" your project details across sessions.

## Quick Setup

1. Copy the [custom instructions below](#memory-bank-custom-instructions)
2. Add to custom instructions or a `.clinerules` file
3. Ask Cline to "initialize memory bank"

## How It Works

Memory Bank files are regular markdown files in your project that both you and Cline can access. They're organized hierarchically to build a complete picture of your project:

```
memory-bank/
├── projectbrief.md      # Foundation document
├── productContext.md    # Why this project exists
├── activeContext.md     # Current work focus
├── systemPatterns.md    # Architecture & patterns
├── techContext.md       # Tech stack & setup
└── progress.md          # Status & milestones
```

## Core Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `projectbrief.md` | Foundation document with core requirements and goals |
| `productContext.md` | Why the project exists, problems it solves, UX goals |
| `activeContext.md` | Current focus, recent changes, next steps (updates most frequently) |
| `systemPatterns.md` | Architecture, design patterns, component relationships |
| `techContext.md` | Tech stack, setup, constraints, dependencies |
| `progress.md` | What works, what's left, known issues |

## Key Commands

- **"follow your custom instructions"** - Tells Cline to read Memory Bank and continue where you left off
- **"initialize memory bank"** - Creates the initial structure for a new project
- **"update memory bank"** - Triggers a full documentation review and update

## Managing Context Windows

When your context window fills up:

1. Ask Cline to "update memory bank" to document current state
2. Start a new conversation
3. Ask Cline to "follow your custom instructions"

This preserves important context before the window clears, letting you continue seamlessly.

## Best Practices

- Start with a basic project brief and let structure evolve
- Let Cline help create initial structure
- `activeContext.md` changes most frequently
- `progress.md` tracks milestones
- Update after significant milestones or direction changes

## Memory Bank Custom Instructions

Copy this into custom instructions or a `.clinerules` file:

```markdown
# Cline's Memory Bank

I am Cline, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships
   - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.
```

## FAQ

**Custom instructions or .clinerules?**
Either works. Custom instructions apply globally. `.clinerules` is project-specific and stored in your repo.

**How often should I update?**
After significant milestones or direction changes. For active development, every few sessions.

**Does this work with other AI tools?**
Yes. Memory Bank is a documentation methodology that works with any AI that can read docs. Commands may differ but the approach works across tools.

**Different from README files?**
Memory Bank provides structured, comprehensive documentation designed for AI context management, going beyond what a single README covers.
