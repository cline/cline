Web Tools give Cline the ability to search the internet and fetch content from specific URLs during your tasks. This is useful when you need up-to-date information, documentation lookups, or research that goes beyond your local codebase and the LLM's internal knowledge.

<Warning>
	Web Tools require the **Cline provider**. They are not available when using other providers like OpenRouter, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, etc.
</Warning>

## How Web Tools Work

Cline has two web tools:

- **web_search**: Searches the web and returns a list of relevant webpages based on your query
- **web_fetch**: Fetches and analyzes content from a specific URL

When Cline determines that web information would help complete your task, it will use these tools automatically. The tools call Cline's backend API, which handles the search or fetch operation and returns the results.

## Enabling Web Tools

Web Tools are available when using the Cline provider. To use them:

1. Make sure you're signed in to Cline
2. Ensure you're using the Cline provider
3. Enable the Web Tools toggle in the Feature Settings menu

<Note>
	Web tools can be auto-approved using the "Use the browser" setting in [Auto Approve](/features/auto-approve).
</Note>
