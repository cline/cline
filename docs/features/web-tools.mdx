Web Tools give Beadsmith the ability to search the internet and fetch content from specific URLs during your tasks. This is useful when you need up-to-date information, documentation lookups, or research that goes beyond your local codebase and the LLM's internal knowledge.

<Warning>
	Web Tools require the **Beadsmith provider**. They are not available when using other providers like OpenRouter, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, etc.
</Warning>

## How Web Tools Work

Beadsmith has two web tools:

- **web_search**: Searches the web and returns a list of relevant webpages based on your query
- **web_fetch**: Fetches and analyzes content from a specific URL

When Beadsmith determines that web information would help complete your task, it will use these tools automatically. The tools call Beadsmith's backend API, which handles the search or fetch operation and returns the results.

## Enabling Web Tools

Web Tools are available when using the Beadsmith provider. To use them:

1. Make sure you're signed in to Beadsmith
2. Ensure you're using the Beadsmith provider
3. Enable the Web Tools toggle in the Feature Settings menu

<Note>
	Web tools can be auto-approved using the "Use the browser" setting in [Auto Approve](/features/auto-approve).
</Note>
