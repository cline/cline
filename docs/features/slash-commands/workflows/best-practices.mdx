Creating effective workflows requires a balance of clear instructions, modular design, and intelligent tool usage. Follow these best practices to get the most out of Cline's automation capabilities.

## Use Cline to Build Workflows

We highly recommend using Cline to help you build your workflows. Since Cline understands your project's context and structure, it can be an invaluable partner in designing automation that fits your specific needs.

### Building your own workflows

Creating a workflow is simpler than you might think. There's actually a workflow for building workflows! Type `/create-new-workflow.md` ([view source](https://github.com/cline/prompts/blob/main/workflows/create-new-workflow.md)) and Cline guides you through it:

1.  It asks for the purpose and a concise name.
2.  You describe the objective and expected outputs.
3.  You list the major steps (Cline can help determine details).
4.  It generates the properly structured workflow file.

<Tip>
  **Automate Your History:** The best workflows come from tasks you've already done. After completing something you'll need to repeat, tell Cline: "Create a workflow for the process I just completed." It analyzes the conversation, identifies the steps, and generates the workflow file. Your accumulated context becomes reusable automation.
</Tip>

Workflows live in `.clinerules/workflows/` for project-specific ones or `~/Documents/Cline/Workflows/` for global ones you use across projects. Project workflows take precedence when names match.

## Workflow Design

<Tip>
  **Start Simple:** Begin with small, single-task workflows. As you get comfortable, you can combine them or create more complex sequences.
</Tip>

### 1. Be Modular
Instead of creating one massive workflow file, break complex tasks into smaller, reusable workflows. This makes them easier to maintain and debug.

### 2. Use Clear Comments
Just like with code, commenting your workflow steps is crucial. Explain *why* a step is happening, not just *what* is happening. This helps both you (the future maintainer) and Cline understand the intent.

```markdown
# Good Commenting
## 3. Run Tests
I need to run the test suite to ensure the new changes didn't break anything.
```

### 3. Version Control
Treat your workflows as part of your codebase. Store them in your Git repository (in `.clinerules/workflows/`) so they are versioned, reviewed, and shared with your team.

## Prompt Engineering for Cline

### 1. Be Specific with Tool Use
Don't just say "find the file." Be explicit about which tool Cline should use.

*   **Bad:** "Find the user controller."
*   **Good:** "Use `search_files` to look for `UserController` in the `src/controllers` directory."

### 2. Leverage Interactive Tools
Use `ask_followup_question` to make your workflows interactive. This allows you to provide input or confirmation at critical steps.

## Advanced Techniques

### Leverage MCP Tools
You can use Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools within your workflows to interact with external services like GitHub, Slack, or databases. This allows you to create powerful end-to-end automations.

### Manage Context Window
Be mindful of Cline's context window. If a workflow is too long or processes too much data, it might exceed the token limit.
*   **Break it down:** Split long workflows into smaller parts.
*   **Be concise:** keep instructions clear and to the point.
