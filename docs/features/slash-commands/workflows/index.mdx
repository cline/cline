Workflows in Beadsmith are Markdown files that define a series of steps to guide Beadsmith through repetitive or complex tasks. They are a powerful way to automate your development processes directly within your editor.

To invoke a workflow, you simply type `/` followed by the workflow's filename in the chat (e.g., `/deploy.md`).

## Why Use Beadsmith Workflows?

*   **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks like setting up a new project, deploying a service, or running a specific test suite.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure that tasks are performed the same way every time, reducing errors.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Don't waste mental energy remembering complex sequences of commands or steps.
*   **Contextual:** Workflows run within your project's context, so Beadsmith has access to your files and can use its tools to interact with them.

## How They Work

A workflow file is a standard Markdown file with a `.md` extension. Beadsmith reads this file and interprets the instructions step-by-step. The real power comes from Beadsmith's ability to use its built-in tools and other capabilities within these instructions:

*   **Beadsmith Tools:** Use tools like `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `execute_command`, and `ask_followup_question`.
*   **Command-Line Tools:** Instruct Beadsmith to use any CLI tool installed on your machine (e.g., `git`, `gh`, `npm`, `docker`).
*   **MCP Tools:** Reference tools from connected Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## Workflows vs. Rules

It's important to understand the difference between Beadsmith Workflows and Beadsmith Rules, as they serve different purposes:

| Feature | Purpose | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Beadsmith Rules** | Define *how* Beadsmith should behave generally. They are always active (or contextually triggered) and set the "ground rules" for your project. | Enforcing coding standards, tech stack preferences, or project-specific constraints (e.g., "Always use TypeScript", "Never edit the `db` folder"). |
| **Beadsmith Workflows** | Define *what* specific task Beadsmith should perform. They are sequences of steps invoked on-demand to automate a process. | Automating repetitive tasks like creating a component, running a release process, or generating a daily report. |

Think of **Rules** as the *environment* Beadsmith works in, and **Workflows** as the *scripts* you give Beadsmith to execute.

### Example: Automating a Release

Imagine you need to prepare a new release for your library.

**Without a workflow**, you might have to manually:
1.  Open `package.json` and bump the version number.
2.  Run your test suite to make sure everything is green.
3.  Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the latest commits.
4.  Run `git commit -am "v1.0.1"`.
5.  Run `git tag v1.0.1`.
6.  Run `git push origin main --tags`.

This is tedious and easy to mess up. You might forget to run the tests or format the changelog correctly.

**With a Beadsmith workflow**, you define these steps once in a `release.md` file. Then, you just type:

```bash
/release.md
```

Beadsmith will then meticulously follow your instructions: updating files, running tests, and executing git commands—pausing only if it encounters an error or needs your input.

## Where are Workflows Stored?

You can store workflows in two locations, depending on whether they are specific to a project or meant to be global.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Project-Specific Workflows">
    Store workflows that are specific to a single project in a `.beadsmithrules/workflows/` directory in your project's root.

    1.  Create a `.beadsmithrules` folder in your project's root directory (if it doesn't already exist).
        <Note>
          The `.beadsmithrules` directory may be hidden by default on some systems. You might need to enable **Show Hidden Files** to see it.
        </Note>
    2.  Inside `.beadsmithrules`, create a `workflows` folder.
    3.  Create your Markdown workflow files (e.g., `deploy.md`) in this folder.

    These workflows will only be available when you have this specific project open.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Global Workflows">
    Store workflows that you want to use across all your projects in a global directory.

    *   **macOS/Linux:** `~/Documents/Beadsmith/Workflows/`
    *   **Windows:** `C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Beadsmith\Workflows\`

    Create your Markdown workflow files directly in this directory. They will be available in any project you open with Beadsmith.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Manage Workflows

You can easily manage your workflows directly within the extension. This feature provides a unified interface to handle all your automation needs without leaving your editor or hunting through file directories. It consolidates both project-specific rules and global workflows into one view, giving you full control over your automation environment.

1.  Click the **Manage Beadsmith Rules and Workflows** button (<Icon icon="scale-balanced" />) at the bottom of the extension.
2.  This opens an interface where you can:
    *   **View all available workflows:** See a comprehensive list of both project-specific and global workflows.
    *   **Control automation:** Toggle individual workflows on and off as needed for your current task.
    *   **Create and Edit:** Add new workflows or modify existing ones directly within the interface.
    *   **Clean up:** Delete workflows you no longer need.

## Workflow Structure Example

Here is a simple example of a workflow file (`daily-changelog.md`) that helps you create a daily changelog.

````markdown daily-changelog.md
# Daily Changelog Generator

This workflow helps you create a changelog for your daily work.

1.  **Check your recent git commits:**
    I will run the following command to see your commits from today.
    ```bash
    git log --author="$(git config user.name)" --since="yesterday" --oneline
    ```

2.  **Summarize your work:**
    I will present the commits to you and ask for a summary of your changes to be added to the `changelog.md` file.

3.  **Create/Append to daily changelog:**
    I will append to the `changelog.md` file. The content will include a header with the current date, the list of commits, and your summary.
````

### Breakdown of the Workflow

This workflow demonstrates that you don't always need to provide specific tool calls (like XML blocks). Beadsmith is smart enough to interpret your high-level instructions.

1.  **Step 1: Check recent git commits**
    *   We give Beadsmith a specific command to run. This ensures it gets exactly the data we want (today's commits).
    <Tip>
      After Beadsmith shows the git commit history, you may need to click the **Proceed While Running** button to allow the workflow to continue.
    </Tip>

2.  **Step 2: Summarize your work**
    *   Instead of forcing a specific tool, we simply tell Beadsmith what to do: "ask for a summary".
    *   Beadsmith knows it needs to use its capabilities to ask you a question.

3.  **Step 3: Create/Append to daily changelog**
    *   We describe the desired outcome: "append to the `changelog.md` file" with specific content.
    *   Beadsmith figures out how to format the file and use its file-writing tools to accomplish the task.
