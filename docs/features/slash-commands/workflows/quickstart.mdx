In this tutorial, you will create a powerful workflow that automates the process of reviewing a GitHub Pull Request. This example demonstrates how to combine CLI tools, file analysis, and user interaction into a seamless process.

### Prerequisites

*   You have Cline installed.
*   You have the [GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated.
*   You have a Git repository open with a Pull Request you want to test this on.

## Creating a Pull Request Review Workflow

This workflow will automate the process of fetching PR details, analyzing the code changes for issues, and drafting a review comment.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Workflow File">
    First, create the directory structure for your project-specific workflows.

    1.  In the root of your project, create a new folder named `.clinerules`.
    2.  Inside `.clinerules`, create another folder named `workflows`.
    3.  Finally, create a new file named `pr-review.md` inside the `workflows` folder.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write the Workflow Content">
    Open the `pr-review.md` file and add the following content. This workflow will gather PR details, analyze the changes, and help you submit a review.

    ````markdown pr-review.md
    # Pull Request Reviewer

    This workflow helps me review a pull request by analyzing the changes and drafting a review.

    ## 1. Gather PR Information
    First, I need to understand what this PR is about. I'll fetch the title, description, and list of changed files.

    ```bash
    gh pr view PR_NUMBER --json title,body,files
    ```

    ## 2. Examine Modified Files
    Now I will examine the diff to understand the specific code changes.

    ```bash
    gh pr diff PR_NUMBER
    ```

    ## 3. Analyze Changes
    I will analyze the code changes for:
    *   **Bugs:** Logic errors or edge cases.
    *   **Performance:** Inefficient loops or operations.
    *   **Security:** Vulnerabilities or unsafe practices.

    ## 4. Confirm Assessment
    Based on my analysis, I will present my findings and ask how you want to proceed.

    ```xml
    <ask_followup_question>
      <question>I've reviewed PR #PR_NUMBER. Here is my assessment:

    [Insert Analysis Here]

    Do you want me to approve this PR, request changes, or just leave a comment?</question>
      <options>["Approve", "Request Changes", "Comment", "Do nothing"]</options>
    </ask_followup_question>
    ```

    ## 5. Execute Review
    Finally, I will execute the review command based on your decision.

    ```bash
    # If approving:
    gh pr review PR_NUMBER --approve --body "Looks good to me! [Summary of analysis]"

    # If requesting changes:
    gh pr review PR_NUMBER --request-changes --body "Please address the following: [Issues list]"

    # If commenting:
    gh pr review PR_NUMBER --comment --body "[Comments]"
    ```
    ````

    <Note>
      When you run this workflow, you will replace `PR_NUMBER` with the actual number of the pull request you want to review (e.g., `/pr-review.md 123`).
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run the Workflow">
    Now you're ready to run your new workflow.

    1.  Open the Cline chat panel.
    2.  Type `/pr-review.md` followed by the PR number (e.g., `/pr-review.md 42`) and press Enter.
    3.  Cline will fetch the PR details, analyze the code, and present you with its findings before submitting the review.

    <Tip>
      As Cline executes commands (like `gh pr view`), it may show you the output and pause. You will need to click the **Proceed While Running** button to allow Cline to analyze the content and continue with the workflow.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Other Common Use Cases

This is just one example. You can create workflows for a wide variety of tasks, such as:

*   **Creating Components:** Automate the boilerplate for new files (like React components or API endpoints).
*   **Running Tests:** Create a workflow that runs your test suite and summarizes the results.
*   **Deploying Your Application:** Automate your deployment pipeline using tools like `docker` and `kubectl`.
*   **Refactoring Code:** Guide Cline through a complex refactoring process step-by-step.

Explore Cline's capabilities and your own development processes to find repetitive tasks that can be turned into efficient workflows.
