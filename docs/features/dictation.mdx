Dictation transforms how you work with AI. Instead of typing out complex thoughts, you speak naturally and share your complete intent. This isn't just about speed - though voice is faster - it's about unlocking the kind of fluid collaboration that typing can't match.

## Why Voice Changes Everything

When you type, you edit yourself. You simplify complex ideas, skip context, and lose nuance. When you speak, you share everything on your mind - the full problem, the constraints, the edge cases you're worried about.

Use Dictation constantly in [Plan mode](/features/plan-and-act) for rapid back-and-forth discussions. Instead of typing careful, structured prompts, think about a problem. Cline asks clarifying questions, respond immediately, and iterate until having a solid plan.

The friction of typing was holding back real collaboration. Voice removes that friction.

## Getting Started

**Enable Dictation:**
1. Go to Settings → Features → Dictation
2. Toggle "Enable Dictation" on
3. Sign into your Cline account when prompted
4. Install FFmpeg if you haven't already (Cline will guide you)

Once enabled, you'll see a microphone button in the chat input area.

**Using Dictation:**
- Click the microphone button to start recording
- Speak naturally
- Click again to stop recording
- Wait for transcription to appear in the chat

<Tip>
Dictation works with any AI model you've configured. The transcription happens through Cline's service, but your conversation continues with whatever model you're using.

## System Requirements

Dictation uses FFmpeg to capture your voice across all platforms:

- **macOS**: FFmpeg (via Homebrew: `brew install ffmpeg`)
- **Linux**: FFmpeg (via apt: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`)
- **Windows**: FFmpeg (via winget: `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`)

If you don't have FFmpeg installed, Cline will automatically detect this and prompt you to install it with a single click.

## Where Dictation Shines

### Plan Mode Conversations

Dictation is perfect for [Plan mode](/features/plan-and-act) discussions. Instead of carefully crafting prompts, you can:

- Dictate your entire problem context in one go
- Respond to Cline's questions immediately
- Iterate on ideas without typing friction
- Think out loud while Cline listens

Start a planning session by speaking for 2-3 minutes straight, explaining the full context of what you're trying to build, the constraints you're working with, and the specific challenges you're facing.

### Complex Problem Explanation

Some problems are hard to type out. When you're dealing with:
- Multi-step workflows with edge cases
- Integration challenges across multiple systems  
- Performance issues with specific reproduction steps
- UI/UX problems that need detailed context

Speaking lets you explain the full situation naturally, including all the "oh, and also..." details that matter.

### Code Review and Debugging

When reviewing code or explaining bugs, voice lets you walk through your thought process:
- "This function looks fine, but I'm worried about what happens when..."
- "The issue might be in this section, or possibly this other area..."
- "I tried X and Y, but neither worked because..."

You can share your complete debugging journey instead of just the final question.

## Technical Requirements

**System Requirements:**
- FFmpeg installed on your system
- Active internet connection
- Cline account with transcription credits

**Audio Quality:**
- Records in WebM format with Opus codec
- Mono audio at 16kHz sample rate
- Optimized for voice recognition

**Privacy:**
- Audio recorded locally on your machine
- Only audio files sent for transcription
- No audio stored after transcription
- Temporary files automatically cleaned up

## Cost and Credits

Voice transcription costs $0.006 per minute through your Cline account. For most users, this works out to pennies per session.

A typical 5-minute planning conversation costs about 3 cents. Even heavy voice users rarely spend more than a few dollars per month.

<Note>
Pricing is experimental and may change as we refine the service.

## Best Practices

**Speak Naturally**
Don't try to speak like you type. Use your normal conversational tone and don't worry about perfect grammar.

**Give Context First**
Start with the big picture, then drill down into specifics. "I'm building a React app that needs to handle real-time data, and I'm running into performance issues with the WebSocket connection..."

**Use Voice for Exploration**
Dictation is perfect for exploratory conversations where you're not sure exactly what you need. Start talking through the problem and let the conversation evolve.

**Combine with Text**
You don't have to use voice for everything. Use voice for complex explanations and context, then switch to text for quick follow-ups or code snippets.

## Troubleshooting

**Microphone Not Working**
- Check your IDE permissions for microphone access
- Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed
- Try refreshing VSCode/your editor

**Poor Transcription Quality**
- Speak clearly and at normal volume
- Reduce background noise if possible
- Check your microphone settings

**Connection Issues**
- Verify internet connection
- Check if firewall is blocking Cline's servers
- Try signing out and back into your Cline account

**Authentication Issues**
- Sign out and back into your Cline account if you see authentication errors
- Check that your account has sufficient transcription credits
- Verify your internet connection is stable

**Audio Recording Issues**
- Ensure FFmpeg is properly installed and accessible
- Check that your browser/IDE has microphone permissions
- Try restarting your editor if audio capture fails

## The Future of AI Collaboration

When you can speak your thoughts as fast as you think them, you stop self-editing. You share the full context, the edge cases, the "what if" scenarios that matter. This leads to better solutions and fewer back-and-forth clarifications.
