# Dictation Feature Removed

The dictation (voice-to-text) feature has been removed from Cline as of this release.

## What Happened?

The voice input feature that allowed you to speak to Cline instead of typing has been discontinued and is no longer available in the extension.

## Alternative Workflows

While the built-in dictation feature is no longer available, you can still work efficiently with Cline using these approaches:

### 1. System-Level Voice Input

Both macOS and Windows offer built-in dictation features that work across all applications:

- **macOS**: Press `Fn` twice (or `Fn Fn`) to activate dictation in any text field
- **Windows**: Press `Windows + H` to open voice typing
- **Linux**: Various desktop environments offer voice input through accessibility features

These system-level tools will work in Cline's chat input just like any other text field.

### 2. Copy-Paste from Voice Notes

If you prefer to think out loud:
1. Use your phone's voice recorder or a voice memo app
2. Transcribe using your preferred tool (many phones have built-in transcription)
3. Copy and paste the transcribed text into Cline

### 3. Third-Party Transcription Tools

Many standalone transcription tools can be used alongside Cline:
- Browser-based transcription services
- Desktop transcription applications
- AI-powered note-taking apps with transcription features

## Why Was It Removed?

The dictation feature was removed to streamline Cline's core functionality and focus development efforts on the primary AI assistance capabilities.

## Questions?

If you have questions about this change or need help setting up alternative voice input methods, please reach out through Cline's support channels.
