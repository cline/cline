Background Edit lets Cline make file changes without opening the diff editor, so you can keep writing code while Cline works on other files in the background.

<Note>
  This feature is marked as experimental.
</Note>

## How It Works

By default, Cline opens a side-by-side diff editor tab for each file it modifies. With Background Edit enabled:

- Edits write directly to your files without opening new tabs
- Changes appear as collapsible diff blocks in the chat panel
- Your editor focus stays on whatever file you had open

## Enabling Background Edit

1. Click the settings icon (gear) in the top-right corner of the Cline panel
2. Go to "**Feature Settings**"
3. Toggle "**Enable Background Edit**" on

## Viewing Changes

File changes display directly in the chat panel with:

- **File action icons** showing whether the file was added, updated, or deleted
- **Stats** showing additions (+) and deletions (-) at a glance
- **Collapsible diffs** you can expand or collapse by clicking the file header
- **Real-time streaming** as changes appear line-by-line

Green highlights additions, red highlights deletions.

## When to Use It

This feature works well when you:

- Use [auto-approve mode](/features/auto-approve) and prefer reviewing changes after the fact
- Work on tasks with many small file changes
- Want to stay focused on your current file

Stick with the default diff editor if you prefer reviewing each change before it saves, or need to make inline edits to Cline's proposed changes.

## Relationship with Other Features

- **Checkpoints**: Still created after each file operation
- **Auto-approve**: Pairs well for uninterrupted workflows
- **Message editing**: Restoring from a previous message works as expected
