Focus Chain is a task management enhancement feature in Cline that provides automatic todo list management with real-time progress tracking throughout your tasks. 

This enables Cline to work on long-horizon tasks, seamlessly managing the context sent to LLMs, and keeping Cline on track across many context window resets.

<Tip>
  Focus Chain works particularly well with Cline's [Deep Planning slash command](/features/slash-commands/deep-planning), providing seamless progress tracking for implementation tasks created through the [planning process](/features/plan-and-act).
</Tip>

## Key Features

### Automatic Todo List Generation

Cline analyzes your task and automatically creates a comprehensive todo list with:
- Clear, actionable items in markdown checklist format
- Logical breakdown of complex tasks into manageable steps
- Real-time updates as work progresses

### User-Editable Todo Lists

Todo lists are stored as editable markdown files:
- Direct editing through your preferred markdown editor
- Automatic detection of changes you make
- Seamless integration back into Cline's workflow
- Quick access through the edit button in the task header

### Visual Progress Tracking

The task header displays clear progress indicators:
- **Step counters** showing current progress (e.g., "3/8")
- **Completed items** clearly marked with checkmarks
- **Current work** highlighted with indicators
- **Expandable view** to see the full todo list

### Smart Reminder System

Configurable reminders ensure todo lists stay current:
- Default reminder every 6 messages (customizable 1-100)
- Automatic prompts when switching from Plan Mode to Act Mode
- User-triggered updates when todo lists are manually edited

      - Navigate to the "Features" section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Focus Chain">

## Usage Examples

#### 1. Task Initiation

When you start a new task with Focus Chain enabled:

``` markdown User Request
User: "Create a user authentication system for my React app"

Cline: [Analyzes request and creates todo list]
```

#### 2. Todo List Created

Cline creates a comprehensive plan for the task, stored in a markdown file:

```markdown Todo List Created
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Install authentication dependencies
- [ ] Create user registration component
- [ ] Implement login functionality
- [ ] Add password validation
- [ ] Set up user database schema
- [ ] Write authentication tests
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
```

#### 3. Progress Tracking

As Cline works, the task header shows real-time progress:

```markdown Todo List Header
[3/8] Implement login functionality     ⌄
```

Click to expand and see the full list:

```markdown Full Todo List
✓ Set up project structure
✓ Install authentication dependencies
✓ Create user registration component
○ Implement login functionality  ← Currently working
○ Add password validation
○ Set up user database schema
○ Write authentication tests
○ Deploy to staging environment
```

#### 4. User Editing

Need to tweak the todo list? No problem.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the todo list">
    Click the edit button in the expanded todo view
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the markdown file">
    A markdown file opens in your editor:

    ```markdown Editing Todo List
    # Focus Chain Todo List for Task abc123

    <!-- Edit this markdown file to update your focus chain todo list -->
    <!-- Use - [ ] for incomplete items and - [x] for completed items -->

    - [x] Set up project structure
    - [x] Install authentication dependencies (e.g., Firebase Auth)
    - [x] Create user registration component
    - [ ] Implement login functionality
    - [ ] Add password reset feature
    - [ ] Set up protected routes
    - [ ] Implement logout functionality
    - [ ] Add user profile page
    - [ ] Write authentication tests
    - [ ] Deploy to staging environment

    <!-- Save this file to update the task's todo list -->
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Add, remove, or reorder items as needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the file">
    Cline automatically detects and uses your updates
  </Step>
</Steps>

## File Structure

### Todo List Storage

Todo lists are stored as markdown files in your task directory:

``` markdown
<VSCode Global Storage>/
  tasks/
    <taskId>/
      focus_chain_taskid_<taskId>.md
      ... other task files
```

### Markdown Format

Todo files use standard markdown checklist syntax:

```markdown Example Todo Syntax
# Focus Chain Todo List for Task abc123

<!-- Edit this markdown file to update your focus chain todo list -->
<!-- Use the format: - [ ] for incomplete items and - [x] for completed items -->

- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Install authentication dependencies
- [ ] Create user registration component
- [ ] Implement login functionality
- [ ] Add password validation
- [ ] Set up user database schema
- [ ] Write authentication tests
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment

<!-- Save this file and the todo list will be updated in the task -->
```


## Integration with Plan/Act Mode

Focus Chain works seamlessly with Cline's [Plan/Act mode](/features/plan-and-act):

- **Plan Mode**: Optional todo lists for presenting concrete steps
- **Act Mode**: Automatic todo creation when switching from Plan Mode

<Tip>
  For complex projects, start in Plan Mode to discuss and refine your approach before switching to Act Mode for implementation.
</Tip>
