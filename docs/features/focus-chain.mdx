Focus Chain is automatic todo list management with real-time progress tracking. It helps Cline work on longer tasks by maintaining a visible checklist that persists across context window resets.

## When to Use It

Focus Chain works best for:
- Multi-step implementations (building a feature end-to-end)
- Tasks that might span multiple context windows
- Work where you want visibility into Cline's plan

For quick, single-step requests, Focus Chain adds overhead without much benefit.

<Tip>
Focus Chain pairs well with [Deep Planning](/features/deep-planning). Use `/deep-planning` to create a detailed implementation plan, then let Focus Chain track progress as you execute it.

## Enabling Focus Chain

1. Click the gear icon in the Cline sidebar
2. Navigate to "Features"
3. Check "Enable Focus Chain"
4. Optionally adjust "Remind Cline Interval" (default: 6 messages)

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Enable Focus Chain | Disabled | Enables enhanced task progress tracking |
| Remind Cline Interval | 6 | How often Cline updates the todo list (1-100 messages) |

## How It Works

When you start a task with Focus Chain enabled, Cline:

1. Analyzes your request and creates a comprehensive todo list
2. Stores it as an editable markdown file
3. Updates progress in real-time as work progresses
4. Shows a progress indicator in the task header (e.g., "3/8")

The todo list uses standard markdown checklist syntax:

```markdown
- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Install authentication dependencies
- [ ] Create user registration component
- [ ] Implement login functionality  ← Currently working
- [ ] Add password validation
- [ ] Write authentication tests
```

## Editing Todo Lists

Need to adjust the plan? Click the edit button in the expanded todo view. A markdown file opens in your editor where you can add, remove, or reorder items. Save the file and Cline automatically detects your updates.

For complex projects, start with [Plan Mode](/core-workflows/plan-and-act) to discuss the approach before committing to a todo list.
