# Jupyter Notebooks

Cline provides comprehensive support for Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files), enabling AI-assisted editing with full cell-level context awareness. This feature was developed in collaboration with Amazon to bring AI coding assistance to data science workflows.

## Enabling notebook support

Jupyter notebook support is an opt-in feature. To enable it:

1. Open Cline settings in VS Code
2. Navigate to **Settings → Features**
3. Enable **Enhanced Notebook Interaction**

Once enabled, three new commands become available in the command palette whenever you're working with `.ipynb` files.

## Commands

### cline.generateCell

Generate new notebook cells with AI assistance. Describe what you want and Cline creates a properly structured cell that fits into your notebook.

**How it works:** The AI receives context from surrounding cells, so it understands the variables and imports already in scope. This means you can reference existing DataFrames, functions, and other objects without re-explaining them.

**Example prompt:** "Create a visualization showing the correlation matrix of numeric columns with a heatmap"

The cell is inserted with proper notebook JSON structure, preserving metadata and ready to execute.

### cline.explainCell

Get a detailed explanation of what a cell does. This is useful for:

- Revisiting old notebooks
- Onboarding to a teammate's analysis
- Understanding complex transformations

**How it works:** Cline extracts the full cell context, including outputs, so explanations can reference actual results like column names, row counts, and computed values.

### cline.improveCell

Enhance existing cells with AI suggestions. Use this to:

- Optimize slow pandas operations
- Add error handling
- Refactor for clarity
- Convert loops to vectorized operations

**How it works:** Cline suggests improvements while preserving the cell's position and metadata in the notebook structure. The AI explains what was changed and why.

## How cell context works

Unlike traditional file editing, Jupyter notebooks are JSON documents containing arrays of cells. Each cell has its own type, source content, metadata, execution count, and outputs.

When you use a Jupyter command, Cline extracts structured context that includes:

- **Cell type** (code, markdown, or raw)
- **Source content** as an array of lines
- **Cell metadata** and configuration
- **Execution count** for code cells
- **Outputs** including data, text, and error traces

This structured representation allows the AI to understand not just the code, but its context within the notebook and its actual output.

### JSON structure preservation

Cline operates on the cell JSON structure directly, which means:

- Cell boundaries stay intact
- Execution counts are preserved
- Cell metadata remains untouched
- Outputs stay associated with their source cells

You don't need to worry about the AI breaking your notebook's format.

## Keyboard shortcuts

You can bind any of these commands to keyboard shortcuts for faster access:

1. Open VS Code keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + K, Cmd/Ctrl + S)
2. Search for `cline.generateCell`, `cline.explainCell`, or `cline.improveCell`
3. Assign your preferred key combinations

## Tips for best results

**For generateCell:**
- Be specific about what you want the cell to do
- Reference existing variables by name (the AI can see them)
- Mention preferred libraries if you have a preference (e.g., "use seaborn" or "use plotly")

**For explainCell:**
- Works best on cells that have been executed (outputs provide additional context)
- Good for complex chained operations like pandas groupby/merge sequences

**For improveCell:**
- Mention what aspect you want to improve (performance, readability, error handling)
- The AI will explain the changes it suggests

## Limitations

- Notebook support requires the Enhanced Notebook Interaction setting to be enabled
- Cell context extraction depends on VS Code's notebook API
- Very large notebooks may require more context than some models can handle efficiently
