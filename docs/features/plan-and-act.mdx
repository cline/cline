Plan & Act modes separate thinking from doing. Plan mode lets you explore and strategize without changing files. Act mode executes against your plan.

## Plan Mode

Plan mode is where you and Cline figure out what you're building and how. In this mode, Cline can read your codebase and discuss strategy, but won't modify any files.

Use Plan mode to:

- Explore unfamiliar codebases before making changes
- Discuss architecture decisions and tradeoffs
- Identify edge cases and potential issues upfront
- Create a clear implementation strategy

<Tip>
	Try [Dictation](/features/dictation) in Plan mode. Instead of typing out complex requirements, speak naturally and share your complete thought process.
</Tip>

## Act Mode

Once you have a plan, switch to Act mode. Cline retains the full context from your planning session and can now modify files, run commands, and execute your strategy.

## Typical Workflow

1. Start in Plan mode and describe what you want to build
2. Let Cline explore relevant files and understand the codebase
3. Discuss the approach, considering edge cases and potential issues
4. When confident in the plan, switch to Act mode
5. Cline implements the solution based on your planning session

For complex projects, you may cycle between modes. Return to Plan mode when you hit unexpected complexity or need to rethink the approach.

## When to Use Each Mode

**Plan mode works best for:**

- Starting new features where the approach isn't obvious
- Debugging tricky issues where you're unsure what's wrong
- Making architectural decisions affecting multiple files
- Understanding complex workflows before modifying them

**Act mode is ideal for:**

- Implementing a solution you've already planned
- Making routine changes with a clear approach
- Following established patterns in the codebase
- Running tests and making adjustments

## Tips

- Have Cline write a markdown file summarizing the plan for future reference
- Use [file mentions](/features/at-mentions/file-mentions) to point Cline at relevant files during planning
- Switch back to Plan mode when encountering unexpected complexity rather than pushing through
- Enable [Checkpoints](/features/checkpoints) before Act mode so you can roll back if needed
