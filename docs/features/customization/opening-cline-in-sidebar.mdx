## VS Code

To open Cline in the right sidebar:

1. Make sure your extension view is aligned vertically to the left
2. Click the button that opens the right side view in VS Code (the one VS Code uses for GitHub Copilot)
3. Drag the Cline icon over to the nav panel at the top of that right view

</Frame>

## Cursor

To open Cline in the right sidebar:

1. Make sure your extensions are aligned vertically to the left
2. Click the little cube button that opens Cursor's agent (right side view panel)
3. Drag the Cline icon specifically to the three dots - it doesn't work if you just drag it to the top, it has to be the three dots

	/>
</Frame>

Once set up, Cline will load on the right side and you can use it as normal.
