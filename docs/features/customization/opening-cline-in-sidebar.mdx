## Cursor

To open Cline in the right sidebar:

  <Step title="Align Extensions">
    Make sure your extensions are [aligned vertically](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/migrations/vscode#activity-bar-orientation) to the left
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Agent Panel">
    Click the little cube button that opens Cursor's agent (right side view panel)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag to Three Dots">
    Drag the Cline icon specifically to the three dots - it doesn't work if you just drag it to the top, it has to be the three dots
  </Step>
</Steps>
