By default, when you first install Beadsmith, it appears in VS Code's left sidebar alongside your file explorer and other extensions. However, for a better coding experience, we recommend moving Beadsmith to the right sidebar. This allows you to keep your project files visible in the left sidebar while chatting with Beadsmith on the right, giving you full visibility of your codebase as Beadsmith works on your project.

## VS Code

To open Beadsmith in the right sidebar:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Align Extension View">
    Make sure your extension view is aligned vertically to the left
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Right Side View">
    Click the button that opens the right side panel in VS Code (typically used to open GitHub Copilot chat). Optionally use the `Option + CMD/Ctrl + B` shortcut.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag Beadsmith Icon">
    Drag the Beadsmith icon over to the nav panel at the top of that right view
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cursor

To open Beadsmith in the right sidebar:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Align Extensions">
    Cursor uses a horizontal activity bar by default to optimize space for the AI chat interface ([see here for details](https://cursor.com/docs/configuration/migrations/vscode#activity-bar-orientation)). To switch to vertical:
    
    1. Open the Command Palette (`CMD/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
    2. Search for "Preferences: Open Settings (UI)"
    3. Search for `workbench.activityBar.orientation`
    4. Set the value to `vertical`
    5. Restart Cursor for the changes to take effect
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the AI Pane">
    Click the Cursor cube icon button (AI Pane) that opens Cursor's agent (right side view panel)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drag Beadsmith to the AI Pane Sidebar">
    Drag the Beadsmith icon directly into the AI Pane sidebar.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once set up, Beadsmith will load on the right side and you can use it as normal.
