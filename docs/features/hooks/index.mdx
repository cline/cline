---

Hooks let you inject custom logic into Cline's workflow at key moments. Think of them as automated checkpoints where you can validate operations before they execute, monitor tool usage as it happens, and shape how Cline makes decisions.

Hooks run automatically when specific events happen during development. They receive detailed information about each operation, can block problematic actions before they cause issues, and can inject context that guides future AI decisions.

The real power comes from combining these capabilities. You can:

- Stop operations before they cause problems (like creating `.js` files in a TypeScript project)
- Learn from what's happening and build up project knowledge over time
- Monitor performance and catch issues as they emerge
- Track everything for analytics or compliance
- Trigger external tools or services at the right moments

<Warning>
Hooks are currently supported on macOS and Linux only. Windows support is not available.

## Getting Started

Enabling hooks in Cline is straightforward. Here's what you need to do:

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Hooks in Settings">
Open Cline settings and check the **"Enable Hooks"** checkbox.

You can find this setting by:
1. Opening Cline
2. Click the "Settings" button on the top right corner
3. Click the "Feature" section in the left side navigation menu.
4. Scroll down until you see the "Enable Hooks" checkbox and check it. 
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Your Hook Location">
Decide where to place your hooks:

**For personal or organization-wide hooks:**
- Create hooks in `~/Documents/Cline/Rules/Hooks/`
- These apply to all workspaces automatically

**For project-specific hooks:**
- Create hooks in `.clinerules/hooks/` in your project root
- These only apply to the specific workspace
- Commit them to version control so your team can use them too
</Step>

<Step title="Create Your First Hook">
Hook files must have exact names with no file extensions. For example, to create a TaskStart hook:

```bash
# Create the hook file
vim .clinerules/hooks/TaskStart
```

Add your script (must start with shebang)
``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Store piped input into a variable
input=$(cat)

# Dump the entire JSON payload
echo "$input" | jq .

# Get the type of a field
echo "$input" | jq -r '.timestamp | type'
```

This example script demonstrates the key mechanics of hook input/output: reading the JSON payload from stdin with `input=$(cat)`, and using `jq` to inspect the data structure and field types that your hook receives. This helps you understand what data is available before building more complex hook logic.

**Make it executable**

```bash
chmod +x .clinerules/hooks/TaskStart
```
</Step>

<Step title="Test Your Hook">
Start a task in Cline and verify your hook executes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Start with a simple hook that just logs information before building complex validation logic. This helps you understand the data structure and timing.

## What You Can Build

Once you understand the basics, hooks open up creative possibilities:

The key is combining hooks with external tools. A hook can be the glue between Cline's workflow and the rest of your development ecosystem.
