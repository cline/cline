---

Hooks let you inject custom logic into Cline's workflow at key moments. Think of them as automated checkpoints where you can validate operations before they execute, monitor tool usage as it happens, and shape how Cline makes decisions.

Hooks run automatically when specific events happen during development. They receive detailed information about each operation, can block problematic actions before they cause issues, and can inject context that guides future AI decisions.

The real power comes from combining these capabilities. You can:

- Stop operations before they cause problems (like creating `.js` files in a TypeScript project)
- Learn from what's happening and build up project knowledge over time
- Monitor performance and catch issues as they emerge
- Track everything for analytics or compliance
- Trigger external tools or services at the right moments

<Warning>
Hooks are currently supported on macOS and Linux only. Windows support is not available.

## Getting Started

Setting up hooks in Cline is user-friendly with the built-in hooks management interface. Here's how to get started:

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the Hooks Interface">
Navigate to the Hooks management interface:

1. Open Cline (ensure hooks are enabled in settings)
2. Look for the **Hooks** tab at the top (alongside Rules and Workflows)
3. Click on **Hooks** to open the hooks management panel

The interface shows you all available hook types and existing hooks organized by workspace.
</Step>

<Step title="Understand Hook Locations">
Hooks are automatically organized by location in the interface:

**Global Hooks** - Apply to all workspaces:
- Stored in `~/Documents/Cline/Rules/Hooks/`
- Perfect for personal coding standards and universal rules

**Workspace-Specific Hooks** - Apply only to current project:
- Stored in `.clinerules/hooks/` in your project root
- Great for project-specific validation and team workflows
- Can be committed to version control for team sharing

Multi-workspace setups show hooks from all your open workspaces, making it easy to manage hooks across different projects.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Your First Hook">
Use the intuitive interface to create hooks:

1. **Choose your location**: Decide between Global Hooks or workspace-specific hooks
2. **Select hook type**: Click the **"New hook..."** dropdown in your chosen location
3. **Pick a hook type**: Choose from available options like:
   - `TaskStart` - Runs when tasks begin
   - `PreToolUse` - Validates operations before execution  
   - `PostToolUse` - Processes results after tools complete
   - `UserPromptSubmit` - Enhances user input
4. **Enable the hook**: Toggle the switch to activate it
5. **Edit the hook**: Click the pencil icon to add your custom logic

**Example starter script:**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Store piped input into a variable
input=$(cat)

# Dump the entire JSON payload
echo "$input" | jq .

# Get the type of a field
echo "$input" | jq -r '.timestamp | type'
```

This example demonstrates the key mechanics: reading JSON from stdin and using `jq` to inspect the data structure.
</Step>

<Step title="Test Your Hook">
Start a task in Cline and verify your hook executes. You can:
- Check the hook's toggle switch shows it's active
- Monitor Cline's behavior for your hook's effects
- Use the edit button to refine your hook logic as needed
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Start with a simple hook that just logs information before building complex validation logic. This helps you understand the data structure and timing.

## What You Can Build

Once you understand the basics, hooks open up creative possibilities:

The key is combining hooks with external tools. A hook can be the glue between Cline's workflow and the rest of your development ecosystem.
