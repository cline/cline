Cline Rules provide system-level guidance for your projects. Rules persist across conversations, ensuring consistent behavior without repeating instructions in every chat.

## How It Works

Rules are loaded when Cline starts a task. Here's what happens:

**Loading order**: Cline checks for rules in this sequence:
1. `.clinerules/` folder (all `.md` files inside)
2. Single `.clinerules` file
3. `AGENTS.md` file

**Scope precedence**: Workspace rules override global rules when both define the same guidance.

**Multiple files**: When using a `.clinerules/` folder, all Markdown files are combined into one ruleset. Numeric prefixes (like `01-`, `02-`) control the order.

**Conditional activation**: Rules with YAML frontmatter activate only when you're working with matching files. See [Conditional Rules](/features/cline-rules/conditional-rules) for details.

## Supported Rule Files

Cline reads rules from multiple file formats in your workspace root, letting you share rules across different AI coding tools:

| File/Folder | Source | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `.clinerules/` | Cline | Folder with `.md` files (recommended) |
| `.cursor/rules/` | Cursor | Folder with `.mdc` files |
| `.windsurf/rules` | Windsurf | Folder with multiple `md` files |
| `AGENTS.md` | Universal | Follows [agents.md](https://agents.md/) standard, searched recursively |

Cline prioritizes `.clinerules` when present. Other formats load only if no `.clinerules` exists (except `AGENTS.md`, which always searches subdirectories). All rules appear in the Rules popover where you can toggle them.

## Creating Rules

Click the `+` button in the Rules tab to create a new rule. This opens a file in your editor where you write your guidance.

</Frame>

When you save the file, it's stored in:
- **Workspace rules**: `.clinerules/` in your project root
- **Global rules**: Platform-specific location (see table below)

You can also use the [`/newrule` slash command](/features/slash-commands/new-rule) to have Cline generate a rule based on your description.

### Global Rules Location

| Operating System | Default Location |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Windows** | `Documents\Cline\Rules` |
| **macOS** | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` |
| **Linux/WSL** | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` or `~/Cline/Rules` |

<Note>
Linux/WSL users: Check both locations if you don't find global rules in `~/Documents/Cline/Rules`.
</Note>

## Managing Rules

The Rules popover (below the chat input) shows active rules and lets you toggle them on or off.

</Frame>

The popover displays:
- **Global rules**: From your user-level Rules directory
- **Workspace rules**: From `.clinerules/` in your project

Toggle any rule to enable or disable it. Disabled rules won't load, even if they match conditions.

## When to Use Rules

Rules work best for persistent project context:

- **Code standards**: Formatting preferences, naming conventions, project-specific patterns
- **Documentation requirements**: Where to add docs, what format to follow
- **Architecture decisions**: Design patterns, dependency rules, module boundaries
- **Team conventions**: PR processes, branch naming, commit message format
- **Technology constraints**: Required libraries, banned APIs, version requirements

Rules are less effective for:
- One-time instructions (just say it in the chat)
- Complex multi-step workflows (use [Workflows](/features/slash-commands/workflows/index) instead)
- Dynamic decisions that depend on runtime context

## Example Rule

```markdown
# Backend API Guidelines

## Route Handlers

- Use async/await, not callbacks
- Validate request bodies with Zod schemas
- Return typed errors from `src/errors.ts`
- All routes require authentication unless in `publicRoutes` array

## Database Access

- All queries go through repository classes in `src/repositories/`
- Use transactions for multi-table updates
- Never expose raw database errors to clients

## Testing

- Unit tests for business logic in `src/services/`
- Integration tests for route handlers in `src/routes/`
- Mock external APIs, not internal modules
```

This rule provides clear, actionable guidance without explaining obvious concepts or using vague language.

## Using a Folder Structure

For projects with many rules, organize them in a `.clinerules/` folder:

```
your-project/
├── .clinerules/
│   ├── 01-coding-standards.md
│   ├── 02-documentation.md
│   └── 03-testing.md
├── src/
└── ...
```

Cline loads all Markdown files in `.clinerules/` automatically. The numeric prefixes help you control ordering, but they're optional.

### Organizing a Rules Bank

Maintain a separate folder for rules you might need but don't always want active:

```
your-project/
├── .clinerules/              # Active rules
│   ├── 01-coding.md
│   └── client-a.md
│
├── clinerules-bank/          # Available but inactive
│   ├── clients/
│   │   ├── client-a.md
│   │   └── client-b.md
│   └── frameworks/
│       ├── react.md
│       └── vue.md
└── ...
```

Copy files from the bank to `.clinerules/` when you need them. This keeps your active context lean while maintaining a library of reusable guidance.

Switch contexts with simple file operations:

```bash
# Switch to Client B
rm .clinerules/client-a.md
cp clinerules-bank/clients/client-b.md .clinerules/
```

<Tip>
Consider git-ignoring `.clinerules/` while tracking `clinerules-bank/` so team members can activate the rules relevant to their current work.
</Tip>

## Conditional Rules

Scope rules to specific file patterns using YAML frontmatter. This keeps React guidance out of Python code and backend rules away from frontend work.

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "src/components/**"
  - "src/hooks/**"
---

# React Guidelines

Use functional components with hooks. Extract reusable logic into custom hooks.
```

This rule activates only when working with files matching those patterns. Read the [Conditional Rules guide](/features/cline-rules/conditional-rules) for pattern syntax, behavior details, and more examples.

## Tips for Effective Rules

**Be specific**: "Use async/await for all database calls" beats "write good async code."

**Show patterns**: Include file paths and real examples. "Follow the error handling in `src/utils/errors.ts`" gives Cline a concrete reference.

**Focus on outcomes**: Describe what you want, not step-by-step instructions. Let Cline figure out how.

**Test and refine**: Start with core standards. Add rules when you find yourself repeating the same feedback.

**Use conditional rules**: Load guidance only when relevant. This keeps context efficient and reduces noise.
