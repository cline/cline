Cline Rules allow you to provide Cline with system-level guidance. Think of them as a persistent way to include context and preferences for your projects or globally for every conversation.

## Creating a Rule

You can create a rule by clicking the `+` button in the Rules tab. This will open a new file in your IDE which you can use to write your rule.

</Frame>

Once you save the file:

-   Your rule will be stored in the `.clinerules/` directory in your project (if it's a Workspace Rule)
-   Or in the Global Rules directory (if it's a Global Rule):

### Global Rules Directory Location

The location of your Global Rules directory depends on your operating system:

| Operating System | Default Location | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Windows** | `Documents\Cline\Rules` | Uses system Documents folder |
| **macOS** | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` | Uses user Documents folder |
| **Linux/WSL** | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` | May fall back to `~/Cline/Rules` on some systems |

> **Note for Linux/WSL users**: If you don't find your global rules in `~/Documents/Cline/Rules`, check `~/Cline/Rules` as the location may vary depending on your system configuration and whether the Documents directory exists.

You can also have Cline create a rule for you by using the [`/newrule` slash command](/features/slash-commands/new-rule) in the chat.

## Documentation Requirements

-   Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
-   Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
-   Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in /docs/adr for:

-   Major dependency changes
-   Architectural pattern changes
-   New integration patterns
-   Database schema changes
    Follow template in /docs/adr/template.md

## Code Style & Patterns

-   Generate API clients using OpenAPI Generator
-   Use TypeScript axios template
-   Place generated code in /src/generated
-   Prefer composition over inheritance
-   Use repository pattern for data access
-   Follow error handling pattern in /src/utils/errors.ts

## Testing Standards

-   Unit tests required for business logic
-   Integration tests for API endpoints
-   E2E tests for critical user flows
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Version Controlled**: The `.clinerules` file becomes part of your project's source code
2. **Team Consistency**: Ensures consistent behavior across all team members
3. **Project-Specific**: Rules and standards tailored to each project's needs
4. **Institutional Knowledge**: Maintains project standards and practices in code

Place the `.clinerules` file in your project's root directory:

```
your-project/
├── .clinerules
├── src/
├── docs/
└── ...
```

Cline's system prompt, on the other hand, is not user-editable ([here's where you can find it](https://github.com/cline/cline/blob/main/src/core/prompts/system.ts)). For a broader look at prompt engineering best practices, check out [this resource](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview).

### AGENTS.md Standard Support

Cline also supports the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) standard as a fallback 
(in addition to Cline Rules) by automatically detecting `AGENTS.md` files in 
your workspace root. This allows you to use the same rules file across different AI 
coding tools.

```
your-project/
├── AGENTS.md
├── src/
└── ...
```

### Tips for Writing Effective Cline Rules

-   Be Clear and Concise: Use simple language and avoid ambiguity.
-   Focus on Desired Outcomes: Describe the results you want, not the specific steps.
-   Test and Iterate: Experiment to find what works best for your workflow.

### .clinerules/ Folder System

```
your-project/
├── .clinerules/              # Folder containing active rules
│   ├── 01-coding.md          # Core coding standards
│   ├── 02-documentation.md   # Documentation requirements
│   └── current-sprint.md     # Rules specific to current work
├── src/
└── ...
```

Cline automatically processes **all Markdown files** inside the `.clinerules/` directory, combining them into a unified set of rules. The numeric prefixes (optional) help organize files in a logical sequence.

#### Using a Rules Bank

For projects with multiple contexts or teams, maintain a rules bank directory:

```
your-project/
├── .clinerules/              # Active rules - automatically applied
│   ├── 01-coding.md
│   └── client-a.md
│
├── clinerules-bank/          # Repository of available but inactive rules
│   ├── clients/              # Client-specific rule sets
│   │   ├── client-a.md
│   │   └── client-b.md
│   ├── frameworks/           # Framework-specific rules
│   │   ├── react.md
│   │   └── vue.md
│   └── project-types/        # Project type standards
│       ├── api-service.md
│       └── frontend-app.md
└── ...
```

#### Benefits of the Folder Approach

1. **Contextual Activation**: Copy only relevant rules from the bank to the active folder
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Update individual rule files without affecting others
3. **Team Flexibility**: Different team members can activate rules specific to their current task
4. **Reduced Noise**: Keep the active ruleset focused and relevant

#### Usage Examples

Switch between client projects:

```bash
# Switch to Client B project
rm .clinerules/client-a.md
cp clinerules-bank/clients/client-b.md .clinerules/
```

Adapt to different tech stacks:

```bash
# Frontend React project
cp clinerules-bank/frameworks/react.md .clinerules/
```

#### Implementation Tips

-   Keep individual rule files focused on specific concerns
-   Use descriptive filenames that clearly indicate the rule's purpose
-   Consider git-ignoring the active `.clinerules/` folder while tracking the `clinerules-bank/`
-   Create team scripts to quickly activate common rule combinations

The folder system transforms your Cline rules from a static document into a dynamic knowledge system that adapts to your team's changing contexts and requirements.

### Conditional Rules

Conditional rules let you scope rules to specific parts of your codebase. Rules activate only when you're working with matching files, keeping your context focused and relevant.

- **Without conditionals**: every rule loads for every request.
- **With conditionals**, rules activate only when your current files match their defined scope.

For example, React component rules should appear when you're working with React components, not when you're editing Python or documentation.

#### How It Works

Conditional rules use YAML frontmatter at the top of your rule files. When Cline processes a request, it gathers context from your current work (open files, visible tabs, mentioned paths, edited files), evaluates each rule's conditions, and activates matching rules.

<Note>
When a conditional rule activates, you'll see a notification: **"Conditional rules applied: workspace:frontend-rules.md"**
</Note>

#### Writing Conditional Rules

Add YAML frontmatter to the top of any rule file in your `.clinerules/` directory:

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "src/components/**"
  - "src/hooks/**"
---

# React Component Guidelines

When creating or modifying React components:
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Extract reusable logic into custom React hooks
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
```

The `---` markers delimit the frontmatter. Everything after the closing `---` is your rule content.

##### The `paths` Conditional

Currently, `paths` is the supported conditional. It takes an array of glob patterns:

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "src/**"           # All files under src/
  - "*.config.js"      # Config files in root
  - "packages/*/src/"  # Monorepo package sources
---
```

**Glob pattern syntax:**

- `*` matches any characters except `/`
- `**` matches any characters including `/` (recursive)
- `?` matches a single character
- `[abc]` matches any character in the brackets
- `{a,b}` matches either pattern

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `src/**/*.ts` | All TypeScript files under `src/` |
| `*.md` | Markdown files in root only |
| `**/*.test.ts` | Test files anywhere in the project |
| `packages/{web,api}/**` | Files in web or api packages |
| `src/components/*.tsx` | TSX files directly in components (not nested) |

##### Behavior Details

**Multiple patterns**: A rule activates if any pattern matches any file in your context.

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "frontend/**"
  - "mobile/**"
---
# Activates when working in frontend OR mobile
```

**No frontmatter**: Rules without frontmatter are always active.

**Empty paths array**: `paths: []` means the rule never activates. Use this to temporarily disable a rule.

**Invalid YAML**: If frontmatter can't be parsed, Cline fails open: the rule activates with raw content visible to help debugging.

#### What Counts as "Current Context"

Cline evaluates rules based on:

1. **Your message**: File paths mentioned in your prompt (e.g., "update `src/App.tsx`")
2. **Open tabs**: Files currently open in your editor
3. **Visible files**: Files visible in your active editor panes
4. **Edited files**: Files Cline has created, modified, or deleted during the task
5. **Pending operations**: Files Cline is about to edit

Conditional rules can activate on your first message, when relevant files are open, or mid-task when Cline starts working with matching files.

<Tip>
Be explicit about file paths in your prompts. "Update `src/services/user.ts`" reliably triggers path-based rules; "update the user service" may not.
</Tip>

#### Practical Examples

##### Frontend vs Backend Rules

Keep frontend and backend rules separate to avoid noise:

```yaml
# .clinerules/frontend.md
---
paths:
  - "src/components/**"
  - "src/pages/**"
  - "src/hooks/**"
---

# Frontend Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prefer server components where possible
- Keep client components small and focused
```

```yaml
# .clinerules/backend.md
---
paths:
  - "src/api/**"
  - "src/services/**"
  - "src/db/**"
---

# Backend Guidelines

- Use dependency injection for services
- All database queries go through repositories
- Return typed errors, not thrown exceptions
```

##### Test File Rules

Enforce testing standards automatically:

```yaml
# .clinerules/testing.md
---
paths:
  - "**/*.test.ts"
  - "**/*.spec.ts"
  - "**/__tests__/**"
---

# Testing Standards

- Use descriptive test names: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
- One assertion per test when possible
- Mock external dependencies, not internal modules
- Use factories for test data, not fixtures
```

##### Documentation Rules

Apply documentation standards only when editing docs:

```yaml
# .clinerules/docs.md
---
paths:
  - "docs/**"
  - "**/*.md"
  - "**/*.mdx"
---

# Documentation Guidelines

- Use sentence case for headings
- Include code examples for all features
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)
- Link to related documentation
```

#### Combining with Rule Toggles

Conditional rules work alongside the rule toggle UI. Toggle off a conditional rule to disable it entirely (it won't activate even if paths match). Toggle on to let it activate when conditions are met.

This provides two levels of control: manual toggles and automatic condition-based activation.

#### Tips for Effective Conditional Rules

**Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with broader patterns and refine as you learn what works:

```yaml
# Start here
paths:
  - "src/**"

# Then narrow down
paths:
  - "src/features/auth/**"
```

**Use Descriptive Filenames**: Name your rule files to indicate their scope:

```
.clinerules/
├── api-endpoints.md      # Rules for API code
├── database-models.md    # Rules for DB layer
├── react-components.md   # Rules for React
└── universal.md          # No frontmatter = always active
```

**Keep Universal Rules Separate**: Put always-on rules (coding standards, project conventions) in files without frontmatter. Reserve conditional rules for context-specific guidance.

#### Troubleshooting Conditional Rules

**Rule not activating:**
- Check that file paths in your context match the glob pattern
- Verify the rule is toggled on in the rules panel
- Ensure YAML frontmatter has proper `---` delimiters

**Rule activating unexpectedly:**
- Review glob patterns: `**` is recursive and may match more than intended
- Check for open files that match the pattern
- File paths mentioned in your message also count as context

**Frontmatter showing in output:**
- YAML couldn't be parsed
- Check for syntax errors (unquoted special characters, improper indentation)

### Managing Rules with the Toggleable Popover

To make managing both single `.clinerules` files and the folder system even easier, Cline v3.13 introduces a dedicated popover UI directly accessible from the chat interface.

Located conveniently under the chat input field, this popover allows you to:

-   **Instantly See Active Rules:** View which global rules (from your user settings) and workspace rules (`.clinerules` file or folder contents) are currently active.
-   **Quickly Toggle Rules:** Enable or disable specific rule files within your workspace `.clinerules/` folder with a single click. This is perfect for activating context-specific rules (like `react-rules.md` or `memory-bank.md`) only when needed.
-   **Easily Add/Manage Rules:** Quickly create a workspace `.clinerules` file or folder if one doesn't exist, or add new rule files to an existing folder.

This UI significantly simplifies switching contexts and managing different sets of instructions without needing to manually edit files or configurations during a conversation.

## Conditional Rules

Cline now supports **conditional rules** that activate automatically based on which files you're working with. This allows you to scope rules to specific parts of your codebase, keeping your context focused and relevant.

For example, React component rules can activate only when you're working with React components, not when you're editing Python or documentation files.
