Conditional rules let you scope rules to specific parts of your codebase. Rules activate only when you're working with matching files, keeping your context focused and relevant.

For an introduction to Cline Rules, see the [Overview](/features/cline-rules/overview).

- **Without conditionals**: every rule loads for every request. 
- **With conditionals**, rules activate only when your current files match their defined scope.

For example, React component rules should appear when you're working with React components, not when you're editing Python or documentation.

## How It Works

Conditional rules use YAML frontmatter at the top of your rule files. When Cline processes a request, it gathers context from your current work (open files, visible tabs, mentioned paths, edited files), evaluates each rule's conditions, and activates matching rules.

<Note>
When a conditional rule activates, you'll see a notification: **"Conditional rules applied: workspace:frontend-rules.md"**
</Note>

## Writing Conditional Rules

Add YAML frontmatter to the top of any rule file in your `.clinerules/` directory:

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "src/components/**"
  - "src/hooks/**"
---

# React Component Guidelines

When creating or modifying React components:
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Extract reusable logic into custom React hooks
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
```

The `---` markers delimit the frontmatter. Everything after the closing `---` is your rule content.

### The `paths` Conditional

Currently, `paths` is the supported conditional. It takes an array of glob patterns:

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "src/**"           # All files under src/
  - "*.config.js"      # Config files in root
  - "packages/*/src/"  # Monorepo package sources
---
```

**Glob pattern syntax:**
- `*` matches any characters except `/`
- `**` matches any characters including `/` (recursive)
- `?` matches a single character
- `[abc]` matches any character in the brackets
- `{a,b}` matches either pattern

**Examples:**

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `src/**/*.ts` | All TypeScript files under `src/` |
| `*.md` | Markdown files in root only |
| `**/*.test.ts` | Test files anywhere in the project |
| `packages/{web,api}/**` | Files in web or api packages |
| `src/components/*.tsx` | TSX files directly in components (not nested) |

### Behavior Details

**Multiple patterns**: A rule activates if any pattern matches any file in your context.

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "frontend/**"
  - "mobile/**"
---
# Activates when working in frontend OR mobile
```

**No frontmatter**: Rules without frontmatter are always active.

**Empty paths array**: `paths: []` means the rule never activates. Use this to temporarily disable a rule.

**Invalid YAML**: If frontmatter can't be parsed, Cline fails open: the rule activates with raw content visible to help debugging.

## What Counts as "Current Context"

Cline evaluates rules based on:

1. **Your message**: File paths mentioned in your prompt (e.g., "update `src/App.tsx`")
2. **Open tabs**: Files currently open in your editor
3. **Visible files**: Files visible in your active editor panes
4. **Edited files**: Files Cline has created, modified, or deleted during the task
5. **Pending operations**: Files Cline is about to edit

Conditional rules can activate on your first message, when relevant files are open, or mid-task when Cline starts working with matching files.

<Tip>
Be explicit about file paths in your prompts. "Update `src/services/user.ts`" reliably triggers path-based rules; "update the user service" may not.
</Tip>

## Practical Examples

Copy these patterns and adapt them to your project structure.

### Frontend vs Backend Rules

Keep frontend and backend rules separate to avoid noise. Frontend rules only load when working with UI code, backend rules only load when working with API or service code.

```yaml
# .clinerules/frontend.md
---
paths:
  - "src/components/**"
  - "src/pages/**"
  - "src/hooks/**"
---

# Frontend Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Prefer server components where possible
- Keep client components small and focused
```

```yaml
# .clinerules/backend.md
---
paths:
  - "src/api/**"
  - "src/services/**"
  - "src/db/**"
---

# Backend Guidelines

- Use dependency injection for services
- All database queries go through repositories
- Return typed errors, not thrown exceptions
```

### Test File Rules

Enforce testing standards automatically. This rule activates only when you're writing or modifying tests, so testing guidance appears exactly when you need it.

```yaml
# .clinerules/testing.md
---
paths:
  - "**/*.test.ts"
  - "**/*.spec.ts"
  - "**/__tests__/**"
---

# Testing Standards

- Use descriptive test names: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
- One assertion per test when possible
- Mock external dependencies, not internal modules
- Use factories for test data, not fixtures
```

### Documentation Rules

Apply documentation standards only when editing docs. Prevents style rules from cluttering your context when you're writing code.

```yaml
# .clinerules/docs.md
---
paths:
  - "docs/**"
  - "**/*.md"
  - "**/*.mdx"
---

# Documentation Guidelines

- Use sentence case for headings
- Include code examples for all features
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences max)
- Link to related documentation
```

## Combining with Rule Toggles

Conditional rules work alongside the rule toggle UI. Toggle off a conditional rule to disable it entirely (it won't activate even if paths match). Toggle on to let it activate when conditions are met.

This provides two levels of control: manual toggles and automatic condition-based activation.

## Tips for Effective Conditional Rules

### Start Broad, Then Narrow

Begin with broader patterns and refine as you learn what works:

```yaml
# Start here
paths:
  - "src/**"

# Then narrow down
paths:
  - "src/features/auth/**"
```

### Use Descriptive Filenames

Name your rule files to indicate their scope:

```
.clinerules/
├── api-endpoints.md      # Rules for API code
├── database-models.md    # Rules for DB layer
├── react-components.md   # Rules for React
└── universal.md          # No frontmatter = always active
```

### Keep Universal Rules Separate

Put always-on rules (coding standards, project conventions) in files without frontmatter. Reserve conditional rules for context-specific guidance.

### Test Your Patterns

Not sure if a pattern matches? Create a simple test rule:

```yaml
---
paths:
  - "your/pattern/here/**"
---

TEST: This rule should activate for your/pattern/here files.
```

Then work with a file in that path and check if you see the activation notification.

## Troubleshooting

**Rule not activating:**
- Check that file paths in your context match the glob pattern
- Verify the rule is toggled on in the rules panel
- Ensure YAML frontmatter has proper `---` delimiters

**Rule activating unexpectedly:**
- Review glob patterns: `**` is recursive and may match more than intended
- Check for open files that match the pattern
- File paths mentioned in your message also count as context

**Frontmatter showing in output:**
- YAML couldn't be parsed
- Check for syntax errors (unquoted special characters, improper indentation)
