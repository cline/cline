YOLO mode is exactly what it sounds like - Beadsmith auto-approves everything. Check the box in feature settings and he'll execute file changes, terminal commands, even transitions from Plan to Act mode without asking.

Think of it as [Auto Approve](/features/auto-approve) on steroids - instead of granular permissions, YOLO mode gives Beadsmith complete autonomy.

<Note>
**Warning: This is dangerous.** YOLO mode disables all safety checks. Beadsmith will execute whatever he decides without asking permission.

## What Gets Auto-Approved

When YOLO mode is enabled, Beadsmith automatically approves:

- **All file operations** - reading, writing, and modifying files anywhere on your system
- **All terminal commands** - including potentially destructive operations
- **Browser actions** - web scraping, form submissions, navigation
- **MCP server tools** - external integrations and API calls
- **Mode transitions** - automatic switching from Plan to Act mode

Essentially, every safety guardrail is removed. Beadsmith operates with complete autonomy.

## How to Enable YOLO Mode

Navigate to Beadsmith Settings → Features and check the "YOLO Mode" box. That's it - no confirmation dialogs, no additional warnings. Once enabled, Beadsmith will start auto-approving all actions immediately.

To disable it, simply uncheck the box. Any pending actions will still require your approval once YOLO mode is turned off.

## When You Might Use This

YOLO mode was built primarily for our upcoming scriptable CLI where fully autonomous execution makes sense. In the GUI, you might consider it for:

**Rapid prototyping** where you want zero friction and don't care about potential mistakes. Perfect for throwaway experiments or exploring new ideas quickly.

**Trusted, repetitive tasks** where you've already validated Beadsmith's approach and want to eliminate approval overhead. Think routine refactoring or well-established patterns.

**Demonstration purposes** where you want to show Beadsmith's capabilities without constant interruptions.

## What Could Go Wrong

Since YOLO mode removes all safety checks, Beadsmith could:

- Delete important files without warning
- Execute commands that modify system settings
- Make network requests to external services
- Overwrite configuration files
- Install or uninstall software packages
- Commit and push changes to version control

The risk level depends entirely on what you ask Beadsmith to do. Simple tasks remain relatively safe, but complex requests can have unpredictable consequences.

## Best Practices

If you decide to use YOLO mode:

**Start with isolated environments.** Use it in throwaway projects or sandboxed environments first. Never enable it on production codebases until you understand the risks.

**Be specific with requests.** Vague instructions combined with unlimited permissions can lead to unexpected results. The clearer your requirements, the more predictable Beadsmith's actions.

**Monitor the output.** Even though Beadsmith doesn't ask for permission, he still shows you what he's doing. Watch the terminal output and file changes as they happen.

**Keep version control handy.** Make sure you can easily revert changes if something goes wrong. Git becomes your safety net when YOLO mode is your workflow.

## Inspiration: What Becomes Possible

With YOLO mode enabled, you can:

**Build entire applications** from a single prompt. Describe what you want and let Beadsmith handle everything - file creation, dependency installation, configuration setup, even deployment scripts.

**Automate complex workflows** that normally require dozens of approval clicks. Data processing pipelines, build system setup, or multi-step refactoring operations become seamless.

**Rapid iteration cycles** where you can quickly test ideas without approval friction. Perfect for exploring different approaches or experimenting with new technologies.

**Live demonstrations** where you can show Beadsmith's full capabilities without stopping to approve every action. Great for presentations or teaching scenarios.

The key is understanding that YOLO mode transforms Beadsmith from an interactive assistant into an autonomous agent. Use that power wisely.
