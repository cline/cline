This guide covers finding MCP servers, adding them to Cline, and configuring their settings.

## Finding MCP Servers

Several places to find MCP servers:

- **[Cline MCP Marketplace](/mcp/mcp-marketplace)**: Browse and install directly from Cline
- **[Official MCP servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)**: GitHub repository
- **[Awesome-MCP servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers)**: Community collection
- **Online directories**: [mcpservers.org](https://mcpservers.org/), [mcp.so](https://mcp.so/), [glama.ai/mcp/servers](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers)

## Adding Servers with Cline

The easiest way to add an MCP server is to have Cline build it for you:

1. Provide Cline with the GitHub repository URL
2. Optionally include the README contents for context
3. Cline clones the repo, builds it, and adds the configuration

Example conversation:
```text
User: "Add the MCP server from https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/brave-search"

Cline: "Cloning the repository. It needs to be built. Should I run 'npm run build'?"

User: "Yes"

Cline: "Build complete. This server needs an API key. Where should I find it?"
```

## Managing Servers

Access server settings through the MCP Servers icon in Cline's top navigation bar.

### Enable/Disable

Toggle the switch next to any server to enable or disable it.

### Restart

Click "Restart Server" if a server becomes unresponsive.

### Delete

Click the trash icon or "Delete Server" button. No confirmation dialog.

### Network Timeout

Set how long to wait for responses (30 seconds to 1 hour, default 1 minute).

## Editing Configuration Files

Settings are stored in `cline_mcp_settings.json`:

1. Click MCP Servers icon
2. Select "Configure" tab
3. Click "Configure MCP Servers"

### STDIO Transport (Local Servers)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your_api_key"
      },
      "alwaysAllow": ["tool1", "tool2"],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

### SSE Transport (Remote Servers)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-server": {
      "url": "https://your-server-url.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-token"
      },
      "alwaysAllow": ["tool3"],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Global MCP Mode

Control how MCP servers affect token usage:

1. Click MCP Servers icon
2. Select "Configure" tab
3. Click "Advanced MCP Settings"

## Using MCP Tools

After configuring a server, Cline automatically detects available tools:

1. Type your request in chat
2. Cline identifies when an MCP tool can help
3. Approve the tool use (or use [auto-approval](/features/auto-approve))

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Server not responding | Check if process is running, verify network connectivity |
| Permission errors | Ensure API keys and credentials are configured |
| Tool not available | Confirm server implements the tool and it's not disabled |
| Slow performance | Increase network timeout for the server |
