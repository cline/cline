Workflows are Markdown files that define a series of steps to guide Cline through repetitive or complex tasks. Type `/` followed by the workflow's filename to invoke it (e.g., `/deploy.md`).

Deploying, setting up a new project, running through a release checklist: these tasks often require remembering a dozen steps, running commands in the right order, and updating files manually. Mess up one step and you're debugging for an hour. Workflows turn those multi-step processes into one command. Type `/release.md` and Cline handles the version bump, runs tests, updates the changelog, commits, tags, and pushes. You just review and approve.

## Workflows vs. Rules

Workflows and [Cline Rules](/customization/cline-rules) serve different purposes:

| Feature | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Rules** | Define *how* Cline behaves generally | Coding standards, tech stack preferences, project constraints |
| **Workflows** | Define *what* specific task to perform | Automating repetitive tasks on-demand |

Think of rules as the *environment* Cline works in, and workflows as the *scripts* you give Cline to execute.

## Quick Start

Creating a workflow is simpler than you might think. Save the [create-new-workflow.md](https://github.com/cline/prompts/blob/main/workflows/create-new-workflow.md) file to your workspace (e.g., in `.clinerules/workflows/`), then type `/create-new-workflow.md`. Cline will guide you through it:

1. It asks for the purpose and a concise name
2. You describe the objective and expected outputs
3. You list the major steps (Cline can help determine details)
4. It generates the properly structured workflow file

<Tip>
  **Automate Your History:** The best workflows come from tasks you've already done. After completing something you'll need to repeat, tell Cline: "Create a workflow for the process I just completed." It analyzes the conversation, identifies the steps, and generates the workflow file. Your accumulated context becomes reusable automation.
</Tip>

## Where Workflows Live

You can store workflows in two locations depending on whether they're project-specific or global.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Project-Specific">
    Store workflows in `.clinerules/workflows/` in your project root. These workflows are only available when you have this specific project open.
    
    ```
    your-project/
    ├── .clinerules/
    │   └── workflows/
    │       ├── deploy.md
    │       └── setup-feature.md
    └── src/
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Global">
    Store workflows you want across all projects in your system's Cline Workflows directory:
    
    | Operating System | Location |
    |------------------|----------|
    | macOS | `~/Documents/Cline/Workflows/` |
    | Windows | `Documents\Cline\Workflows` |
    | Linux/WSL | `~/Documents/Cline/Workflows/` |
    
    Global workflows are available in any project you open with Cline.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Project workflows take precedence when names match global workflows.

## Managing Workflows

Click the scale icon next to the model selector at the bottom of the Cline panel to open the Rules & Workflows panel. Switch to the **Workflows** tab to see your workflows organized into three sections:

- **Enterprise Workflows** appear if your organization manages workflows through remote configuration
- **Global Workflows** lists workflows from your system's Cline Workflows directory
- **Workspace Workflows** shows workflows in your project's `.clinerules/workflows/` folder

Toggle any workflow on or off depending on what you're working on. You can also create new workflow files directly from this panel by clicking "New workflow file..."

## What Workflows Can Use

Workflows can leverage three categories of tools:

### Cline Tools

Use Cline's built-in tools with XML syntax for precise control. For example:

```xml
<execute_command>
  <command>npm run test</command>
  <requires_approval>false</requires_approval>
</execute_command>
```

```xml
<read_file>
  <path>src/config.json</path>
</read_file>
```

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
  <question>Do you want to deploy to production?</question>
  <options>["Yes", "No"]</options>
</ask_followup_question>
```

See the full list of available tools in the [Cline Tools Reference](/tools-reference/all-cline-tools).

### CLI Tools

Instruct Cline to use any command-line tool installed on your machine. Git, npm, docker, gh, make, curl, whatever you have available. You can specify commands directly in your workflow:

```bash
git log --author="$(git config user.name)" --since="yesterday" --oneline
```

### MCP Tools

If you have [MCP servers](/mcp/mcp-overview) connected, you can reference their tools in your workflows. This lets you integrate with external services like GitHub, Slack, databases, or any custom tools your team has built.

## Examples

### Daily Changelog

This workflow helps you create a changelog for your daily work:

````markdown daily-changelog.md
# Daily Changelog Generator

1.  **Check recent git commits:**
    Run the following command to see commits from today.
    ```bash
    git log --author="$(git config user.name)" --since="yesterday" --oneline
    ```

2.  **Summarize the work:**
    Present the commits and ask for a summary to add to `changelog.md`.

3.  **Append to changelog:**
    Append the date, commits, and summary to `changelog.md`.
````

Notice you don't always need specific tool calls. Cline interprets high-level instructions and figures out how to accomplish them.

### Release Workflow

Without a workflow, releasing manually requires:
1. Bump version in `package.json`
2. Run tests
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Commit and tag
5. Push with tags

With a workflow, just type `/release.md` and Cline handles it all, pausing only for errors or input.

## Tips

### Be Specific When Needed

You can mix high-level instructions with explicit tool calls. When precision matters, use the XML syntax:

```xml
<search_files>
  <path>src/controllers</path>
  <regex>UserController</regex>
  <file_pattern>*.ts</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

When flexibility is fine, just describe what you want: "Find all TODO comments in the codebase."

### Keep Workflows Modular

Instead of one massive workflow file, break complex tasks into smaller, reusable workflows. A `setup-db.md`, `run-tests.md`, and `deploy.md` are easier to maintain than one monolithic `do-everything.md`.

### Version Control Your Workflows

Store workflows in `.clinerules/workflows/` and commit them to your repository. Your team can share, review, and improve them together.
