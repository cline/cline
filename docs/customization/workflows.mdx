Workflows are Markdown files that define a series of steps to guide Cline through repetitive or complex tasks. Type `/` followed by the workflow's filename to invoke it (e.g., `/deploy.md`).

## Why Use Workflows?

- **Automation**: Automate tasks like project setup, deployment, or running test suites
- **Consistency**: Tasks are performed the same way every time
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Don't remember complex command sequences
- **Contextual**: Workflows run within your project's context with access to files and tools

## How They Work

A workflow file is standard Markdown with a `.md` extension. Cline reads it and interprets instructions step-by-step. The power comes from Cline's ability to use:

- **Cline Tools**: `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `execute_command`, etc.
- **CLI Tools**: Any tool on your machine (`git`, `npm`, `docker`)
- **MCP Tools**: Tools from connected MCP servers

## Workflows vs. Rules

| Feature | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Rules** | Define *how* Cline behaves generally | Coding standards, tech stack preferences |
| **Workflows** | Define *what* specific task to perform | Automating repetitive tasks on-demand |

Think of rules as the *environment* and workflows as the *scripts*.

## Where to Store Workflows

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Project-Specific">
    Store in `.clinerules/workflows/` in your project root. Only available for this project.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Global">
    Store in `~/Documents/Cline/Workflows/`. Available in all projects.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Managing Workflows

Click the **Manage Cline Rules and Workflows** button at the bottom of the extension to:

- View all available workflows
- Toggle workflows on/off
- Create, edit, and delete workflows

## Example: Daily Changelog

````markdown daily-changelog.md
# Daily Changelog Generator

1.  **Check recent git commits:**
    ```bash
    git log --author="$(git config user.name)" --since="yesterday" --oneline
    ```

2.  **Summarize your work:**
    I will ask for a summary of your changes.

3.  **Append to changelog:**
    I will append the date, commits, and your summary to `changelog.md`.
````

This workflow demonstrates that you don't always need specific tool calls. Cline interprets high-level instructions and figures out how to accomplish them.

## Example: Release Workflow

Without a workflow, releasing manually requires:
1. Bump version in `package.json`
2. Run tests
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Commit and tag
5. Push with tags

With a workflow, just type `/release.md` and Cline handles it all, pausing only for errors or input.
