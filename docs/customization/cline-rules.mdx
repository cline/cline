Cline Rules let you provide system-level guidance that persists across conversations. Think of them as a way to include context and preferences for your projects or globally for every conversation.

## Creating a Rule

Click the `+` button in the Rules tab to open a new file in your IDE.

Once saved:
- Workspace rules go in `.clinerules/` directory in your project
- Global rules go in your Global Rules directory

You can also use the [`/newrule` slash command](/features/slash-commands/new-rule) to have Cline create a rule for you.

### Global Rules Directory

| Operating System | Default Location |
|------------------|------------------|
| Windows | `Documents\Cline\Rules` |
| macOS | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` |
| Linux/WSL | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` |

<Note>
Linux/WSL users: If you don't find global rules in `~/Documents/Cline/Rules`, check `~/Cline/Rules`.
</Note>

## Example Rule

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Code Style & Patterns
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Follow error handling pattern in /src/utils/errors.ts

## Documentation Requirements
- Update relevant docs when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md

## Testing Standards
- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
```

## Directory Structure

Place rules in your project's root:

```
your-project/
├── .clinerules/              # Folder containing active rules
│   ├── 01-coding.md          # Core coding standards
│   ├── 02-documentation.md   # Documentation requirements
│   └── current-sprint.md     # Rules specific to current work
├── src/
└── ...
```

Cline automatically processes all Markdown files inside `.clinerules/`, combining them into a unified set of rules. Numeric prefixes (optional) help organize files logically.

## Rules Bank Pattern

For projects with multiple contexts, maintain a rules bank:

```
your-project/
├── .clinerules/              # Active rules - automatically applied
│   ├── 01-coding.md
│   └── client-a.md
│
├── clinerules-bank/          # Repository of available but inactive rules
│   ├── clients/
│   │   ├── client-a.md
│   │   └── client-b.md
│   ├── frameworks/
│   │   ├── react.md
│   │   └── vue.md
│   └── project-types/
│       ├── api-service.md
│       └── frontend-app.md
└── ...
```

Switch contexts by copying rules:

```bash
# Switch to Client B
rm .clinerules/client-a.md
cp clinerules-bank/clients/client-b.md .clinerules/
```

## Managing Rules with the Popover

The rules popover under the chat input lets you:

- See which global and workspace rules are active
- Toggle specific rule files with a single click
- Create workspace `.clinerules` file or folder
- Add new rule files

## AGENTS.md Support

Cline also supports the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) standard as a fallback, automatically detecting `AGENTS.md` files in your workspace root. This lets you use the same rules file across different AI coding tools.

## Tips for Writing Rules

- **Be clear and concise**: Use simple language, avoid ambiguity
- **Focus on outcomes**: Describe results you want, not specific steps
- **Keep files focused**: Each rule file should cover a specific concern
- **Test and iterate**: Experiment to find what works for your workflow
