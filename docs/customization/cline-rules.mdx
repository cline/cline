Cline Rules are markdown files that provide persistent instructions across all conversations. Instead of repeating the same preferences every time you start a new task, rules let you define them once and have Cline follow them automatically.

Use rules when you want Cline to:
- Follow your team's coding standards (naming conventions, file organization, error handling patterns)
- Understand project-specific context (tech stack, architecture decisions, dependencies)
- Apply consistent documentation or testing requirements
- Remember constraints like "don't modify files in /legacy" or "always use TypeScript"

## Creating Rules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Rules menu">
    At the bottom of the Cline panel, right below the chat input box, click the scale icon to the left of the model selector (labeled "Manage Cline Rules & Workflows"). You'll see two tabs: Rules and Workflows.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select the Rules tab">
    Make sure you're on the Rules tab. You'll see your existing global and workspace rules listed here, each with a toggle to enable or disable it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new rule file">
    Click "New rule file..." and enter a filename (e.g., `coding-standards`). The file will be created with a `.md` extension.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your rule">
    Add your instructions in markdown format. Keep each rule file focused on a single concern.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once saved, workspace rules go in your project's `.clinerules/` directory and global rules go in your system's Cline Rules directory.

You can also use the [`/newrule` slash command](/features/slash-commands/new-rule) to have Cline create a rule interactively.

### Toggling Rules

Every rule in the popover has a toggle to enable or disable it. This gives you fine-grained control over which rules apply to your current task without deleting the rule file.

For example, you might have a strict testing rule that you want to disable when prototyping, or a client-specific rule you only need when working on that client's features. Toggle rules off when they're not relevant and back on when you need them.

### Global vs Workspace Rules

Choosing where to put a rule determines when it applies. Getting this right means less repetition and more relevant context for Cline.

| | Global Rules | Workspace Rules |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Every project | Single project |
| **Location** | System Cline Rules directory | `.clinerules/` in project root |
| **Best for** | Personal coding style, communication preferences, general constraints | Tech stack, team conventions, project-specific constraints |

When both exist, Cline combines them. Workspace rules can override or extend global rules for that specific project.

### Global Rules Directory

| Operating System | Default Location |
|------------------|------------------|
| Windows | `Documents\Cline\Rules` |
| macOS | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` |
| Linux/WSL | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` |

<Note>
Linux/WSL users: If you don't find global rules in `~/Documents/Cline/Rules`, check `~/Cline/Rules`.
</Note>

## Directory Structure

Place rules in your project's root:

```
your-project/
├── .clinerules/              # Folder containing active rules
│   ├── 01-coding.md          # Core coding standards
│   ├── 02-documentation.md   # Documentation requirements
│   └── current-sprint.md     # Rules specific to current work
├── src/
└── ...
```

Cline processes all `.md` and `.txt` files inside `.clinerules/`, combining them into a unified set of rules. Numeric prefixes help organize files logically but are optional.

## Example Rule

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Follow error handling pattern in /src/utils/errors.ts

## Documentation
- Update relevant docs when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities

## Testing
- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
```

I keep my rules focused on one concern per file. A `coding.md` for style, `testing.md` for test requirements, and `project-context.md` for architecture decisions. This makes it easy to toggle specific rules on or off depending on what I'm working on.

## Supported Rule Types

Cline recognizes rules from multiple sources:

| Rule Type | Location | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Cline Rules | `.clinerules/` | Primary rule format |
| Cursor Rules | `.cursorrules` | Automatically detected |
| Windsurf Rules | `.windsurfrules` | Automatically detected |
| AGENTS.md | `AGENTS.md` | [Standard format](https://agents.md/) for cross-tool compatibility |

All detected rule types appear in the Rules popover, where you can toggle them individually.
