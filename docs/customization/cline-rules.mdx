Rules are markdown files that provide persistent instructions across all conversations. Instead of repeating the same preferences every time you start a new task, rules let you define them once and have Cline follow them automatically.

Use rules when you want Cline to:
- Follow your team's coding standards (naming conventions, file organization, error handling patterns)
- Understand project-specific context (tech stack, architecture decisions, dependencies)
- Apply consistent documentation or testing requirements
- Remember constraints like "don't modify files in /legacy" or "always use TypeScript"

## Supported Rule Types

Cline recognizes rules from multiple sources, so you can use existing rule files from other tools:

| Rule Type | Location | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Cline Rules | `.clinerules/` | Primary rule format |
| Cursor Rules | `.cursorrules` | Automatically detected |
| Windsurf Rules | `.windsurfrules` | Automatically detected |
| AGENTS.md | `AGENTS.md` | [Standard format](https://agents.md/) for cross-tool compatibility |

All detected rule types appear in the Rules panel, where you can toggle them individually.


## Where Rules Live

Rules can be stored in two locations: your project workspace or globally on your system.

**Workspace rules** go in `.clinerules/` at your project root. Use these for team standards, project-specific constraints, and anything you want to share with collaborators via version control.

**Global rules** go in your system's Cline Rules directory. Use these for personal preferences that apply across all projects.

```
your-project/
├── .clinerules/              # Workspace rules
│   ├── coding.md             # Coding standards
│   ├── testing.md            # Test requirements
│   └── architecture.md       # Structural decisions
├── src/
└── ...
```

Cline processes all `.md` and `.txt` files inside `.clinerules/`, combining them into a unified set of rules. Numeric prefixes (like `01-coding.md`) help organize files but are optional.

When both workspace and global rules exist, Cline combines them. Workspace rules take precedence when they conflict with global rules. See [Storage Locations](/customization/overview#storage-locations) for more guidance.

### Global Rules Directory

| Operating System | Default Location |
|------------------|------------------|
| Windows | `Documents\Cline\Rules` |
| macOS | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` |
| Linux/WSL | `~/Documents/Cline/Rules` |

<Note>
Linux/WSL users: If you don't find global rules in `~/Documents/Cline/Rules`, check `~/Cline/Rules`.
</Note>


## Creating Rules

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Rules menu">
    Click the scale icon at the bottom of the Cline panel, to the left of the model selector.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new rule file">
    Click "New rule file..." and enter a filename (e.g., `coding-standards`). The file will be created with a `.md` extension.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your rule">
    Add your instructions in markdown format. Keep each rule file focused on a single concern.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can also use the [`/newrule` slash command](/features/slash-commands/new-rule) to have Cline create a rule interactively.

### Toggling Rules

Every rule has a toggle to enable or disable it. This gives you fine-grained control over which rules apply to your current task without deleting the rule file.

For example, you might have a strict testing rule that you want to disable when prototyping, or a client-specific rule you only need when working on that client's features.

## Writing Effective Rules

### Structure

Rules work best when they're scannable and specific. Use markdown structure to organize instructions:

```markdown
# Rule Title

Brief context about why this rule exists (optional but helpful).

## Category 1
- Specific instruction
- Another instruction with example: `like this`
- Reference to file: see /src/utils/example.ts

## Category 2
- More instructions
- Include the "why" when it's not obvious
```

Cline reads rules as context, so formatting matters. Headers help Cline understand the scope of each instruction. Bullet points make individual requirements clear. Code examples show exactly what you want.

### Best Practices

**Be specific, not vague.** "Use descriptive variable names" is too broad. "Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_SNAKE for constants" gives Cline something concrete to follow.

**Include the why.** When a rule might seem arbitrary, explain the reason. "Don't modify files in /legacy (this code is scheduled for removal in Q2)" helps Cline make better decisions in edge cases.

**Point to examples.** If your codebase already demonstrates the pattern you want, reference it. "Follow the error handling pattern in /src/utils/errors.ts" is more effective than describing the pattern from scratch.

**Keep rules current.** Outdated rules confuse Cline and waste context. If a constraint no longer applies, remove it. If your tech stack changes, update the rules.

**One concern per file.** Split rules by topic: `coding.md` for style, `testing.md` for test requirements, `architecture.md` for structural decisions. This makes it easy to toggle specific rules on or off.

<Warning>
Rules consume context tokens. Avoid lengthy explanations or pasting entire style guides. Keep rules concise and link to external documentation when detailed reference is needed.
</Warning>

## Example

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use repository pattern for data access
- Follow error handling pattern in /src/utils/errors.ts

## Documentation
- Update relevant docs when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities

## Testing
- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
```
