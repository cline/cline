The `.clineignore` file tells Cline which files and directories to skip when analyzing your codebase. It works like `.gitignore`: create a file named `.clineignore` in your project root, add patterns for files you want excluded, and Cline will ignore them.

## Why It Matters

Without a `.clineignore`, Cline may load your entire project into context, including dependencies, build artifacts, and generated files. This wastes tokens, increases costs, and can push useful context out of the window.

Adding a `.clineignore` can cut your starting context from 200k+ tokens to under 50k. That means faster responses, lower costs, and the ability to use smaller, cheaper models effectively.

## Creating a .clineignore

Create a file named `.clineignore` in your project root:

```text
# Dependencies
node_modules/
**/node_modules/

# Build outputs
/build/
/dist/
/.next/
/out/

# Testing artifacts
/coverage/

# Environment variables
.env
.env.*

# Large data files
*.csv
*.xlsx
*.sqlite

# Generated/minified code
*.min.js
*.map
```

## Pattern Syntax

`.clineignore` uses the same pattern syntax as `.gitignore`:

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `node_modules/` | The `node_modules` directory |
| `**/node_modules/` | `node_modules` at any depth |
| `*.csv` | All CSV files |
| `/build/` | The `build` directory at the project root only |
| `*.env.*` | Files like `.env.local`, `.env.production` |
| `!important.csv` | Exception: do not ignore this file |

Lines starting with `#` are comments. Blank lines are ignored.

## What to Exclude

Start with these categories and adjust for your project:

**Almost always exclude:**
- Package manager directories (`node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `.venv/`)
- Build outputs (`dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `out/`)
- Coverage reports (`coverage/`)
- Lock files if large (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`)

**Exclude if present:**
- Large data files (`.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.sqlite`, `.parquet`)
- Binary assets (images, fonts, videos)
- Generated code (API clients, protobuf outputs, minified bundles)
- Environment files with secrets (`.env`, `.env.local`)

**Keep accessible:**
- Source code you actively work on
- Configuration files Cline needs to understand (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json`)
- Documentation and READMEs
- Test files (Cline often needs these for context)

## How It Works

When Cline scans your project to build context, it checks each file path against your `.clineignore` patterns. Matching files are excluded from:

- The file listing Cline sees when starting a task
- Automatic context gathering during conversations
- Search results when Cline looks for relevant code

You can still reference ignored files explicitly using [@ mentions](/core-workflows/working-with-files). If you type `@/node_modules/some-package/index.js`, Cline will read that specific file even though `node_modules/` is in your `.clineignore`. The ignore rules control automatic loading, not explicit access.

<Note>
`.clineignore` is separate from `.gitignore`. Files tracked by Git but irrelevant to Cline (like large test fixtures or data files) should go in `.clineignore` even if they're not in `.gitignore`.
</Note>

## Tips

- Add `.clineignore` early in your project. It's easier to start with broad exclusions and narrow them than to debug why context is bloated later.
- Check your token usage in the task header after adding a `.clineignore`. The difference is often dramatic.
- If Cline seems to be missing context about a file, check whether it's being excluded by your ignore patterns.
- For monorepos or multi-root workspaces, each workspace root can have its own `.clineignore`. See [Multi-Root Workspaces](/features/multiroot-workspace) for details.
