## Overview
Cline Enterprise integrates with your existing identity provider (IdP) via WorkOS to deliver secure SSO and zero-touch user lifecycle management. In this guide, you'll connect your IdP (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, or any SAML/OIDC provider), enable just-in-time (JIT) provisioning so new users are created automatically on first sign-in, and configure role mapping so permissions stay aligned with your directory—no manual invites or seat reconciliations required.


## Prerequisites

- [Cline Enterprise License](https://cline.bot/enterprise)
- Access to your identity provider (IdP) configuration (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace)
- Knowledge of your organization's SSO requirements

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Onboard to Cline Enterprise license

Your IdP administrator will receive an email with a link to register their organization with WorkOS during onboarding.

### Step 2: Configure Your Identity Provider

<Info>
For a short overview of where SSO configuration lives (Cline dashboard vs WorkOS vs your IdP), see [SSO Setup](/enterprise-solutions/sso-setup).
</Info>

Connect your identity provider (IdP) to WorkOS:

1. In the WorkOS dashboard, go to **AuthKit → Connections**
2. Click **Add Connection**
3. Select your identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, Generic SAML/OIDC)
4. Follow the provider-specific setup instructions

Each identity provider (IdP) will have its own setup process and required fields. Be sure to follow the specific instructions in the WorkOS dashboard for your chosen provider.
For more explicit instruction on connecting your IdP, refer to the [WorkOS SSO documentation](https://workos.com/docs/authkit/sso)

### Step 3: Configure User Provisioning

Cline Enterprise uses **just-in-time provisioning** that works automatically:

- **Organizations are created automatically**
- **Users gain access automatically** on their first SSO sign-in, once their credentials have been configured by the IdP administrator.
- **Roles sync automatically** from your IdP (Admin/Owner → Admin, Member → Member)
- **No manual user invites or seat management** required

No additional configuration is needed. Users are provisioned automatically when they sign in through SSO.

### Step 4: Configure User Attributes Mapping

User roles are mapped automatically from your IdP:

- **Admin** in IdP → **Admin** role in Cline (Note: The first Owner of the org is created manually during onboarding)
- **Member** in IdP → **Member** role in Cline

<Info>
    For what each role can access, see the [Roles and Permissions](/enterprise-solutions/team-management/managing-members) page.
</Info>

If needed, you can configure additional user attributes in the Cline Admin console:

1. Go to **Settings → Authentication → User Attributes**
2. Map attributes such as email and name based on your IdP configuration

For information about available user attributes, see the [WorkOS User Object Documentation](https://workos.com/docs/authkit/user-management).

### Step 5: Test SSO Connection

Before allowing users to sign in, test the SSO flow to ensure everything is configured correctly.

**To test the connection:**

1. In the WorkOS dashboard (or Cline Admin console if available), locate and click **Test SSO Connection**
2. You'll be redirected to your IdP's login page
3. Enter valid credentials for a test user
4. After successful authentication, you should be redirected back
5. Confirm that the user's information (name, email, role) displays correctly

**Expected outcome:** The test user is authenticated, their account details are visible, and their role matches what's configured in your IdP.

**If the test fails:** Double-check your IdP configuration (redirect URIs, SAML certificates, attribute mappings). See the [WorkOS SSO documentation](https://workos.com/docs/authkit/sso) for troubleshooting guidance.

### User Access

Once SSO is configured, users in your IdP can access Cline automatically without manual invites or account setup.

**First-time sign-in flow:**

1. User navigates to Cline and clicks **Sign in with SSO**
2. User authenticates via your organization's IdP
3. Cline automatically creates their account in your Organization
4. Role is assigned based on their IdP role (see [Step 4](#step-4-configure-user-attributes-mapping))
5. User is redirected to Cline and can begin working

**What happens automatically:**
- Account creation with correct organization assignment
- Role and permission assignment
- Basic profile information (name, email) populated from IdP

**No action required:** Users don't need to request access or wait for approval. Access is granted immediately upon successful IdP authentication.

### Managing Access

All access management and revocation of users is currently handled by your IdP:

- Add users → access granted automatically on first login
- Change roles → updated on next login
- Remove users → access revoked automatically

<Info>
Role changes sync automatically on the user's next sign-in.
</Info>

### Changing your IdP

In order to change to a different IdP, please contact support and we will guide you through this process.

## Verification

Steps to verify successful configuration:

1. **Test User Sign-In**: Have a test user sign in through the SSO flow (access is granted automatically on first login)
2. **Verify User Provisioning**: Confirm that the user is automatically created and has appropriate role permissions
3. **Check User Attributes**: Verify that user information (name, email, organization) is correctly populated
4. **Test Role Changes**: Update a user's role in your IdP and verify it syncs on their next login
5. **Test User Deprovisioning**: Remove a user from your IdP and verify they lose access to Cline on their next login attempt
6. **Review Audit Logs**: Check WorkOS audit logs to ensure authentication events are being recorded
