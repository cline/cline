title: "Cloud Provider Integration"
---

Cline supports major cloud providers like AWS Bedrock and Google's Cloud Vertex; whichever your team currently uses is appropriate, and there's no need to change providers to utilize Cline's features.

For the purpose of this document, we assume your organization will use cloud-based frontier models. Cloud inference providers offer cutting-edge capabilities and the flexibility to select models which best suit your needs.

Certain scenarios may warrant using local models, including handling highly sensitive data, applications requiring consistent low-latency responses, or compliance with strict data sovereignty requirements. If your team needs to utilize local models, see [Running Local Models ](/running-models-locally/read-me-first.mdx)with Cline.

## AWS Bedrock Setup Guides

#### VPC Endpoint Setup

To protect your team's data, Cline supports VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) endpoints, which create private connections between your data and AWS Bedrock. AWS VPCs enhance security by eliminating the need for public IP addresses, network gateways, or complex firewall rulesâ€”essentially creating a private highway for data that bypasses the public internet entirely. By keeping traffic within AWS's private network, teams also benefit from lower latency and more predictable performance when accessing services like AWS Bedrock or custom APIs. For those working with confidential information or operating in highly regulated industries like healthcare or finance, VPCs offers the perfect balance between the accessibility of cloud services and the security of private infrastructure.

1. Consult the [AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/vpc-interface-endpoints.html) to creating VPC endpoints. This document specifies pre-requisites and describes the syntax used for creating VPC endpoints.
2. Follow the directions for [creating a VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/create-interface-endpoint.html#create-interface-endpoint-aws) in the AWS console. The image below pertains to steps 4 and 5 of the AWS guide linked above.
