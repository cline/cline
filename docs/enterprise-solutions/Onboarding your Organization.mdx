description: "This guide explains how administrators configure WorkOS AuthKit for SSO provisioning and user management in Cline Enterprise."
---

## Prerequisites

- [Cline Enterprise License](https://cline.bot/enterprise)
- Access to your identity provider (IdP) configuration (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace)
- Knowledge of your organization's SSO requirements


## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Onboard to Cline Enterprise license

Your IdP administrator will receive a link to register their organization with WorkOS during onboarding.

### Step 2: Configure Your Identity Provider

Connect your identity provider (IdP) to WorkOS:

1. In the WorkOS dashboard, go to **AuthKit → Connections**
2. Click **Add Connection**
3. Select your identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, Generic SAML/OIDC)
4. Follow the provider-specific setup instructions

Each identity provider (IdP) will have its own setup process and required fields. Be sure to follow the specific instructions in the WorkOS dashboard for your chosen provider.
For more explicit instruction on connecting your IdP, refer to the [WorkOS SSO documentation](https://workos.com/docs/authkit/sso)


### Step 3: Configure User Provisioning

Cline Enterprise uses **just-in-time provisioning** that works automatically:

- **Organizations are created automatically** via webhook when configured in WorkOS
- **Users gain access automatically** on their first SSO sign-in, once their credentials have been configured by the IdP administrator.
- **Roles sync automatically** from your IdP (Admin/Owner → Admin, Member → Member)
- **No manual user invites or seat management** required

No additional configuration is needed. Users are provisioned automatically when they sign in through SSO.


### Step 4: Configure User Attributes Mapping

User roles are mapped automatically from your IdP:
- **Admin** in IdP → **Admin** role in Cline (Note: The first Owner of the org is created manually during onboarding)
- **Member** in IdP → **Member** role in Cline

If needed, you can configure additional user attributes in the Cline Admin console:

1. Go to **Settings → Authentication → User Attributes**
2. Map attributes such as email and name based on your IdP configuration

For information about available user attributes, see the [WorkOS User Object Documentation](https://workos.com/docs/authkit/user-management).

### Step 5: Test SSO Connection

Verify the configuration:

1. In the Cline Admin console, click **Test SSO Connection**
2. You should be redirected to your IdP login page
3. After successful authentication, you should be redirected back to Cline
4. Verify that user information is correctly populated

### User Access

On a user's first SSO sign-in:
1. User authenticates via your IdP
2. Their account is automatically created in the Cline Organization 
4. Role is assigned automatically based on their IdP role (see [Step 4](#step-4-configure-user-attributes-mapping))

### Ongoing Synchronization

Changes sync automatically:
- **Role changes** on next sign-in

### Managing Access

All access management and revocation of users is currently handled by your IdP:
- Add users → access granted automatically on first login
- Change roles → updated on next login
- Remove users → access revoked automatically

### Changing your IdP

In order to change to a different IdP, please contact support and we will guide you through this process.

## Verification

Steps to verify successful configuration:

1. **Test User Sign-In**: Have a test user sign in through the SSO flow (access is granted automatically on first login)
2. **Verify User Provisioning**: Confirm that the user is automatically created and has appropriate role permissions
3. **Check User Attributes**: Verify that user information (name, email, organization) is correctly populated
4. **Test Role Changes**: Update a user's role in your IdP and verify it syncs on their next login
5. **Test User Deprovisioning**: Remove a user from your IdP and verify they lose access to Cline on their next login attempt
6. **Review Audit Logs**: Check WorkOS audit logs to ensure authentication events are being recorded
