Yolo Mode enables Cline to operate with increased autonomy by reducing user confirmations and followup questions.

## What is Yolo Mode?

When Yolo Mode is enabled, Cline:

  <Card title="Skips Followup Questions" icon="forward">
    Proceeds with reasonable assumptions instead of asking for clarification
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Auto-Approves Tools" icon="check-circle">
    Automatically approves certain tool executions that would normally require confirmation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Yolo Mode increases automation speed but reduces oversight. Use in development environments only.
</Warning>

## How It Works

### Normal Mode Behavior
```
User: "Update the API endpoint"
Cline: "Which endpoint would you like to update?"
User: "The users endpoint"
Cline: [proceeds with changes]
```

### Yolo Mode Behavior
```
User: "Update the API endpoint"
Cline: [analyzes codebase, identifies users endpoint, proceeds]
```

## Configuration

### For Individual Users

Toggle Yolo Mode in the Cline interface settings:

1. Open Cline settings
2. Find "Yolo Mode" toggle
3. Enable or disable as needed

Changes apply immediately to new tasks.

### For Enterprise Administrators

Control whether users can enable Yolo Mode through remote configuration:

```json
{
  "yoloModeAllowed": false
}
```

When set to `false`, the Yolo Mode toggle is disabled for all users.

## Behavior Changes

When Yolo Mode is enabled:

### Tool Execution
- Most tools execute without asking for approval
- Risky operations may still require confirmation
- All actions are logged for review

### Question Handling
- Cline makes reasonable assumptions from context
- Proceeds without asking followup questions
- Uses available tools to gather information independently

### Plan Mode Interaction
- Automatically switches to Act Mode when appropriate
- Reduces back-and-forth planning discussions
- Focuses on execution over exploration

## Enterprise Considerations

### Security

While Yolo Mode increases automation speed:
- All tool executions are still logged
- Certain operations may still require approval based on your configuration
- Enterprise policies take precedence over user settings

### Monitoring

Track Yolo Mode usage through:
- Telemetry events capture when mode is toggled
- Task history shows which tasks used Yolo Mode
- Standard logging captures all automated decisions
