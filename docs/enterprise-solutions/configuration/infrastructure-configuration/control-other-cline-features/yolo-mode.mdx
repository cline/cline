YOLO Mode enables Cline to operate with complete autonomy, auto-approving all actions without user confirmation. For Enterprise administrators, this page covers how to control access to YOLO Mode across your organization.

<Note>
For complete details about YOLO Mode functionality, risks, and best practices, see [YOLO Mode in Features](/features/yolo-mode).
</Note>

## Overview

When YOLO Mode is enabled, Cline automatically approves all operations including file changes, terminal commands, browser actions, and mode transitions. This provides maximum automation speed but removes all safety guardrails.

<Warning>
YOLO Mode is powerful but potentially dangerous. Administrators should carefully consider which teams or users should have access to this feature.
</Warning>

## Enterprise Administrator Configuration

As an Enterprise administrator, you can control whether users in your organization can enable YOLO Mode through remote configuration.

### Disabling YOLO Mode for All Users

Add the following to your remote configuration JSON:

```json
{
  "yoloModeAllowed": false
}
```

When `yoloModeAllowed` is set to `false`:
- The YOLO Mode toggle is disabled in all user interfaces
- Users cannot enable YOLO Mode even in their local settings
- This policy applies immediately to all team members
- Enterprise policy takes precedence over individual preferences

### Enabling YOLO Mode for All Users

```json
{
  "yoloModeAllowed": true
}
```

When `yoloModeAllowed` is set to `true` or omitted:
- Users can enable or disable YOLO Mode in their local Cline settings
- Individual users make their own decisions about using YOLO Mode
- No organizational restrictions apply

## Enterprise Policy Recommendations

### Recommended Approach

Most organizations should **disable YOLO Mode by default** for the following reasons:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security & Compliance" icon="shield">
    YOLO Mode removes all approval gates, potentially allowing:
    - Unreviewed code changes to critical systems
    - Execution of commands without oversight
    - Automated actions that may violate compliance policies
    - Risk of data exposure through unmonitored operations
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Code Quality Control" icon="code">
    Without approval prompts:
    - Changes happen too quickly to review in real-time
    - Mistakes can compound before detection
    - Quality gates are bypassed
    - Rollback becomes more complex
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Audit Requirements" icon="clipboard-check">
    Many industries require:
    - Documented approval trails for code changes
    - Clear accountability for automated actions
    - Traceable decision-making processes
    - YOLO Mode may conflict with these requirements
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Exceptions: When to Allow YOLO Mode

Consider enabling YOLO Mode for:

**Sandbox/Development Environments**
- Isolated testing environments
- Personal development machines
- Proof-of-concept projects
- Temporary exploratory work

**Specialized Roles**
- DevOps automation engineers (with proper monitoring)
- Research & development teams in sandboxed environments
- Teams with robust rollback and recovery procedures

**Controlled Use Cases**
- Scripted CI/CD pipelines with comprehensive logging
- Automated testing scenarios
- Demonstration or training environments

## Enterprise Considerations

### Security Implications

When YOLO Mode is enabled in your organization:

**Risk Factors:**
- All tool executions happen automatically without human review
- Potential for rapid propagation of mistakes across multiple files
- Reduced opportunity to catch security vulnerabilities before implementation
- Automated operations may bypass existing security controls

**Mitigations:**
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Restrict YOLO Mode to non-production environments
- Require periodic security reviews for teams using YOLO Mode
- Ensure version control and rollback procedures are in place

### Monitoring Requirements

When allowing YOLO Mode in your organization, implement:

**Mandatory Monitoring:**
1. **Real-time Activity Tracking**
   - Monitor which users enable YOLO Mode
   - Track when YOLO Mode is active
   - Log all automated actions taken

2. **Audit Trail Maintenance**
   - Preserve complete history of YOLO Mode sessions
   - Document what was automated and when
   - Maintain records for compliance purposes

3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Alert on unusual patterns of automated actions
   - Flag high-risk operations performed automatically
   - Monitor for potential security incidents

### Monitoring YOLO Mode Usage

When YOLO Mode is enabled (by policy), track usage through:

**Telemetry Events:**
- Captures when users toggle YOLO Mode on/off
- Records which tasks were executed with YOLO Mode enabled
- Provides aggregate usage statistics across your organization

**Task History:**
- Task metadata indicates whether YOLO Mode was active
- Complete action logs show automated approvals
- Enables post-action review and analysis

**Audit Logs:**
- Standard logging captures all automated decisions
- Tool executions are recorded with timestamps
- Provides compliance trail for regulated environments

## Recommended Policies by Organization Size

### Small Teams (5-20 developers)
- **Default:** Disabled
- **Exceptions:** Allow for individual sandbox environments
- **Monitoring:** Basic telemetry sufficient

### Medium Organizations (20-100 developers)
- **Default:** Disabled
- **Exceptions:** Permit for designated dev/test environments only
- **Monitoring:** Required telemetry + regular audit reviews

### Large Enterprises (100+ developers)
- **Default:** Strictly disabled
- **Exceptions:** Require security approval for each use case
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive telemetry + real-time alerting + compliance reporting

## Technical Implementation

### Configuration Management

**Centralized Control through Remote Configuration:**

```json
{
  "yoloModeAllowed": false,
  // Other policies...
}
```

This setting:
- Applies instantly to all connected clients
- Cannot be overridden by individual users
- Persists across Cline restarts
- Is synchronized across all team members

### Policy Enforcement

The enforcement mechanism:
1. Users authenticate with your enterprise configuration server
2. Remote configuration is downloaded and applied
3. Local UI respects enterprise policy settings
4. YOLO Mode toggle is disabled if policy forbids it
5. Users see a message explaining the enterprise restriction

## Compliance Considerations

For organizations in regulated industries:

**SOC 2 Compliance:**
- YOLO Mode may conflict with change management controls
- Document decision to allow/disallow in security policies
- Implement compensating controls if YOLO Mode is permitted

**GDPR/Data Protection:**
- Automated operations must still respect data handling policies
- Ensure YOLO Mode doesn't bypass data protection safeguards
- Maintain audit trails of automated data processing

**Industry-Specific:**
- Financial services: Generally incompatible with Reg requirements
- Healthcare: May violate HIPAA audit trail requirements
- Government: Often conflicts with approval workflow mandates
