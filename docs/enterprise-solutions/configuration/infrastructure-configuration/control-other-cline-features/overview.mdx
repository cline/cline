## General Feature Controls

Enterprise Feature Controls allow you to manage access to Cline's capabilities across four key areas:

### Core AI Features
- **Chat Interface**: Rate limiting and approval requirements based on user roles
- **Code Generation**: File pattern blocking and language-specific restrictions
- **Model Selection**: Role-based access to different AI models and context sizes
- **Context Management**: Control over context window sizes per user role

### Development Tools
- **File Explorer**: Path restrictions and file size warnings for sensitive areas
- **Terminal Access**: Controlled command execution with role-based permissions
- **Browser Automation**: Domain restrictions and approval requirements
- **Git Operations**: Branch protection and repository access controls

### Advanced Features
- **Workflows**: Granular permissions for viewing, running, and creating workflows
- **Hooks**: Control over different hook types and security-sensitive paths
- **Checkpoints**: Storage limits and checkpoint quotas per user role
- **MCP Servers**: Server access restrictions and approval workflows for custom integrations

### Integration Controls
- **External API Access**: Domain allowlists and approval requirements for third-party services
- **Data Export**: Content type restrictions and size limits for exported data
- **Cloud Services**: Regional restrictions and service-specific access controls

## Control Dimensions

Enterprise Feature Controls operate across multiple dimensions to provide comprehensive governance:

### Role-Based Controls
Define feature access based on organizational roles with graduated permissions:
- **Intern**: Limited access with daily quotas and supervised operations
- **Developer**: Standard access to core features with some restrictions
- **Senior Developer**: Extended access including advanced features and limited administrative capabilities
- **Tech Lead**: Full feature access with team-level control permissions
- **Admin**: Complete access with organization-wide control capabilities

### Environment-Specific Controls
Tailor feature availability based on deployment environment:
- **Development**: Full feature access for testing and development activities
- **Staging**: Restricted access with limited external connectivity for testing
- **Production**: Minimal feature access with strict approval requirements and enhanced security

### Project-Specific Controls
Adjust controls based on project sensitivity and classification:
- **Public Projects**: Standard feature access with basic restrictions
- **Internal Projects**: Moderate restrictions with approved domain access
- **Confidential Projects**: Strict access controls with comprehensive audit logging
- **Restricted Projects**: Minimal AI assistance with human oversight requirements

## Implementation Approaches

Feature controls can be implemented through multiple deployment strategies:

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Terraform/CloudFormation**: Deploy feature controls as infrastructure resources
- **Configuration Management**: Use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for consistent deployment across environments
- **Version Control**: Manage feature control configurations alongside application code

### GitOps Integration
- **Automated Validation**: Validate configuration changes before deployment
- **Staged Rollouts**: Deploy feature controls through development, staging, and production environments
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete history of feature control changes

### Dynamic Control Systems
- **Real-Time Adjustments**: Modify feature access without system restarts
- **Emergency Response**: Rapidly disable features during security incidents
- **Approval Workflows**: Route feature requests through organizational approval processes

## Monitoring & Management

Comprehensive monitoring ensures Feature Controls operate effectively:

### Real-Time Dashboards
- **Feature Usage Metrics**: Track adoption and utilization patterns across the organization
- **Access Control Analytics**: Monitor blocked attempts and approval queue metrics
- **Performance Impact**: Assess the operational overhead of feature controls
- **User Activity Tracking**: Understand how different roles interact with available features

### Emergency Response
- **Incident Procedures**: Predefined responses for security incidents, compliance audits, and resource exhaustion
- **Automated Triggers**: Webhook-based activation of emergency controls
- **Escalation Workflows**: Ensure critical situations receive appropriate attention

### Audit & Compliance
- **Access Reports**: Comprehensive user activity and feature usage summaries
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Support for SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, and other regulatory requirements
- **Evidence Collection**: Automated gathering of compliance evidence and documentation

## Enterprise Integration

Feature controls integrate seamlessly with existing enterprise systems:

### Identity Management
- **LDAP/Active Directory**: Synchronize user roles and permissions from enterprise directories
- **SAML/SSO Integration**: Leverage existing single sign-on infrastructure for authentication
- **Group-Based Permissions**: Map organizational groups to feature access levels

### Security Frameworks
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Support least-privilege access principles
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all feature access attempts
- **Threat Response**: Automated feature restrictions in response to security alerts

## Best Practices

### Security-First Approach
1. **Default Deny**: Start with minimal permissions and add as needed
2. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically audit feature permissions and usage
3. **Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum features required for each role
4. **Separation of Duties**: Require multiple approvers for sensitive features
5. **Audit Everything**: Log all feature access attempts and decisions

### User Experience
1. **Clear Communication**: Inform users when features are disabled and why
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Provide alternatives when features are unavailable
3. **Self-Service**: Allow users to request feature access through automated workflows
4. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of available features
5. **Training**: Educate users on approved features and best practices

### Operational Excellence
1. **Automated Testing**: Test feature controls in staging before production
2. **Rollback Capabilities**: Maintain ability to quickly revert feature changes
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance impact of feature controls
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Have plans for emergency feature disabling
5. **Change Management**: Use formal processes for feature control changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Features Not Applying**:
```bash
# Check feature control status
cline-enterprise features status --user alice@company.com

# Validate configuration
cline-enterprise features validate --config feature-controls.yaml

# Sync user permissions
cline-enterprise features sync-permissions --user alice@company.com
```

**Performance Impact**:
```bash
# Monitor feature control overhead
cline-enterprise features metrics --timeframe 1h

# Optimize slow rules
cline-enterprise features optimize --rule complex-permission-rule

# Check cache status
cline-enterprise features cache-status
```

**Approval Workflow Issues**:
```bash
# Check approval queue
cline-enterprise approvals list --status pending

# Escalate stuck approvals
cline-enterprise approvals escalate --request req-12345

# Update approval rules
cline-enterprise features update-approval-rules --dry-run
```

Enterprise Feature Controls provide comprehensive governance over Cline's capabilities while maintaining flexibility for legitimate use cases. Start with basic role-based controls and gradually implement more sophisticated policies as your organization's needs evolve.
