This section covers configuration options for controlling Cline's behavior in enterprise deployments.

## Available Settings

<Card title="YOLO Mode" icon="rocket" href="/enterprise-solutions/configuration/infrastructure-configuration/control-other-cline-features/yolo-mode">
  Control enterprise access to autonomous operation mode with complete auto-approval
</Card>

## Configuration Methods

These settings can be configured through:


### Individual Users
- Users can toggle settings in their local Cline interface
- Enterprise policies can restrict certain settings
- Changes apply immediately to new tasks

## Enterprise Controls

Administrators can enforce policies through remote configuration:

```json
{
  "yoloModeAllowed": false
}
```

When `yoloModeAllowed` is set to `false`, users cannot enable YOLO Mode in their local Cline interface.
