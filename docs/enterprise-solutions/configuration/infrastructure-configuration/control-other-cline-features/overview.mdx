## Available Settings

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Yolo Mode" icon="rocket" href="/enterprise-solutions/configuration/infrastructure-configuration/control-other-cline-features/yolo-mode">
    Enable autonomous operation mode where Cline proceeds without asking followup questions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Telemetry" icon="chart-line" href="/enterprise-solutions/configuration/infrastructure-configuration/control-other-cline-features/telemetry">
    Configure analytics and usage tracking for your deployment
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configuration Methods

These settings can be configured through:

### Self-Hosted Deployments
- Configure via remote configuration JSON
- Settings apply to all team members
- See [Self-Hosted Configuration](/enterprise-solutions/configuration/infrastructure-configuration/overview) for setup details

### Individual Users
- Users can toggle settings in their local Cline interface
- Enterprise policies can restrict certain settings
- Changes apply immediately to new tasks

## Enterprise Controls

Administrators can enforce policies through remote configuration:

```json
{
  "yoloModeAllowed": false,
  "telemetryEnabled": true
}
```

When `yoloModeAllowed` is set to `false`, users cannot enable Yolo Mode. Other settings remain under user control.
