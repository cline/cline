## Overview

Cline's enterprise telemetry system collects usage analytics, performance metrics, and security events to help administrators optimize deployments, ensure compliance, and maintain operational excellence.

## Data Collection

### Usage Analytics

Track how your team uses Cline across your organization:

- **Session Metrics**: Login frequency, session duration, active users
- **Feature Usage**: Tool utilization, command frequency, workflow patterns
- **Project Analytics**: Code generation patterns, file types, project sizes
- **Team Collaboration**: Shared workflows, knowledge transfer metrics

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor system performance and resource utilization:

- **Response Times**: API calls, model inference, tool execution
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, network bandwidth consumption
- **Error Rates**: Failed operations, timeout occurrences, retry patterns
- **Throughput**: Requests per minute, concurrent users, workload distribution

### Security Events

Track security-related activities and compliance:

- **Access Patterns**: Login attempts, permission changes, resource access
- **Data Flow**: Information movement, external integrations, export activities
- **Audit Events**: Administrative actions, policy changes, configuration updates
- **Compliance Metrics**: Regulatory requirement adherence, policy violations

## Privacy and Compliance

### Data Privacy

Enterprise telemetry is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected
- **Local Processing**: Sensitive data remains within your infrastructure
- **Anonymization**: Personal information is anonymized or pseudonymized
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable data retention periods

### Compliance Standards

Supports major compliance frameworks:

- **GDPR**: European data protection compliance
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection (where applicable)

## Configuration

### Telemetry Settings

Configure telemetry collection through your enterprise dashboard:

1. Access enterprise telemetry settings
2. Select data collection categories
3. Set retention periods and storage locations
4. Configure privacy and anonymization rules

### Data Destinations

Choose where telemetry data is stored and processed:

- **On-Premises**: Keep all data within your infrastructure
- **Hybrid**: Selected metrics to approved cloud services
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated cloud instances for your organization
- **Data Lakes**: Integration with existing analytics platforms

### Granular Controls

Fine-tune data collection with granular settings:

- **User-Level**: Individual privacy preferences
- **Team-Level**: Department-specific collection rules
- **Project-Level**: Project-sensitive data handling
- **Feature-Level**: Specific capability monitoring

## Analytics Dashboard

### Real-Time Monitoring

Access live telemetry data through enterprise dashboards:

- **Usage Dashboards**: Current active users, feature usage, system load
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, error rates, resource utilization
- **Security Overview**: Access patterns, security events, compliance status
- **Custom Views**: Tailored analytics for specific business needs

### Historical Analysis

Analyze trends and patterns over time:

- **Usage Trends**: Adoption patterns, feature popularity, user engagement
- **Performance History**: System improvements, capacity planning data
- **Security Analytics**: Threat detection, access pattern analysis
- **Compliance Reporting**: Audit trails, policy adherence metrics

## Integration

### Business Intelligence

Integrate telemetry with existing BI systems:

- **Data Export**: CSV, JSON, API endpoints for data extraction
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time data streaming to external systems
- **Database Connectivity**: Direct database access for analytics tools
- **Report Automation**: Scheduled reports and automated insights

### Alerting and Notifications

Set up automated monitoring and alerts:

- **Performance Alerts**: CPU, memory, response time thresholds
- **Security Notifications**: Unusual access patterns, policy violations
- **Usage Alerts**: Capacity warnings, feature adoption notifications
- **Compliance Alerts**: Regulatory requirement violations, audit reminders
