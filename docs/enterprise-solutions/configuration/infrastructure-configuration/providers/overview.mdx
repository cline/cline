**Configuration Path: Self-Hosted**

This section covers self-hosted infrastructure deployment with YAML configs, Kubernetes/Helm, VPC endpoints, and advanced features. For web-based configuration through app.cline.bot, see [SaaS Provider Configuration](/enterprise-solutions/configuration/remote-configuration/overview).
</Info>

Configure multiple AI providers to support your enterprise development teams with redundancy, cost optimization, and performance tuning. Cline Enterprise supports direct integration with major AI providers through secure, enterprise-grade configurations on your own infrastructure.

## Enterprise Provider Features

### Multi-Provider Strategy
- **Provider Fallback**: Automatic failover between providers for high availability
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across multiple provider endpoints
- **Cost Optimization**: Route requests to most cost-effective providers based on usage patterns
- **Regional Compliance**: Use region-specific providers to meet data sovereignty requirements

### Security & Governance
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and rotation of API keys and service accounts
- **Network Security**: VPC endpoints, private connectivity, and IP whitelisting
- **Audit Logging**: Complete request/response logging for compliance
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-team rate limits to prevent abuse

### Performance Optimization
- **Response Caching**: Intelligent caching of similar requests to reduce costs
- **Request Routing**: Smart routing based on model capabilities and performance
- **Batch Processing**: Optimize bulk operations with provider-specific batching
- **Connection Pooling**: Persistent connections for reduced latency

## Provider Configuration Architecture

```yaml
# Example enterprise provider configuration
providers:
  primary:
    - name: "aws-bedrock-us-east"
      type: "aws-bedrock"
      region: "us-east-1"
      models: ["claude-3-sonnet", "claude-3-haiku"]
      max_requests_per_minute: 1000
      
  fallback:
    - name: "litellm-proxy"
      type: "litellm" 
      endpoint: "https://litellm.company.com/v1"
      models: ["gpt-4", "gpt-3.5-turbo"]
      
routing_rules:
  - condition: "model.startsWith('claude')"
    provider: "aws-bedrock-us-east"
  - condition: "user.team == 'research'"
    provider: "litellm-proxy"
  - default: "aws-bedrock-us-east"
```

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Configuration
- **Development**: Relaxed limits, development models, cost tracking
- **Staging**: Production-like configuration with test data isolation
- **Production**: High availability, strict security, comprehensive monitoring

### Version Control Integration
All provider configurations support GitOps workflows:

```bash
# Deploy provider configuration via GitOps
kubectl apply -f provider-configs/
helm upgrade cline-enterprise ./helm-charts/cline-enterprise \
  --set-file providers=configs/providers.yaml
```

### Configuration Validation
- **Schema Validation**: Ensure configurations meet enterprise requirements
- **Connectivity Testing**: Verify provider endpoints are accessible
- **Permission Validation**: Test service account and API key permissions
- **Load Testing**: Validate rate limits and performance under load

## Monitoring & Observability

Track provider performance and costs with built-in metrics:

### Key Metrics
- **Request Volume**: Requests per second/minute/hour by provider
- **Response Times**: P50, P95, P99 latency metrics by provider and model
- **Error Rates**: HTTP errors, timeouts, and provider-specific errors  
- **Cost Tracking**: Token usage and estimated costs by provider/team/user

### Alerts & Notifications
Configure alerts for:
- Provider availability issues
- Unusual cost spikes
- Rate limit breaches
- Authentication failures

## Best Practices

### Security
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimal required permissions
2. **Credential Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys and service accounts
3. **Network Isolation**: Use private endpoints where available
4. **Request Filtering**: Sanitize requests to prevent prompt injection

### Performance
1. **Provider Selection**: Choose providers based on geographic proximity
2. **Model Selection**: Use appropriate model sizes for different tasks
3. **Caching Strategy**: Cache responses for deterministic queries
4. **Batch Operations**: Group requests for efficiency

### Cost Management
1. **Usage Monitoring**: Track costs by team, user, and project
2. **Budget Alerts**: Set spending limits and automated notifications
3. **Model Optimization**: Use cheaper models for appropriate tasks
4. **Request Optimization**: Optimize prompts to reduce token usage

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Primary Provider**: Select based on compliance and performance requirements
2. **Configure Authentication**: Set up service accounts or API keys
3. **Test Connectivity**: Validate configuration with test requests
4. **Set Up Monitoring**: Enable metrics and alerting
5. **Deploy to Teams**: Roll out configuration to development teams
