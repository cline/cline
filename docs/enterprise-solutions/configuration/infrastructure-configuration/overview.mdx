<Warning>
**Self-Hosted Configuration Path**

This section is for enterprises deploying **self-hosted Cline infrastructure** with complex security, compliance, and multi-environment requirements. Configuration is done through YAML files, Kubernetes/Helm deployments, and infrastructure-as-code.

**Looking for simple setup?** See [SaaS Provider Configuration](/enterprise-solutions/configuration/remote-configuration/overview) for quick configuration through the app.cline.bot admin console - no infrastructure deployment required, just web-based settings.
</Warning>

Self-Hosted Configuration provides centralized control over all aspects of your Cline deployment on your own infrastructure, from AI providers to custom workflows. This section covers how to configure, manage, and optimize your enterprise Cline installation with advanced security, compliance, and operational features.

## Getting Started

1. **Assessment**: Review your current infrastructure and integration requirements
2. **Provider Setup**: Configure your preferred AI providers with enterprise credentials
3. **Security Configuration**: Implement rules and access controls
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Enable telemetry and monitoring for operational visibility
5. **User Onboarding**: Deploy configurations to your development teams

## Enterprise Architecture Considerations

### Security & Compliance
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: All configurations support zero-trust security models
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trails for all configuration changes
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions for different administrative roles
- **Data Sovereignty**: Keep sensitive data within your infrastructure boundaries

### Scalability & Performance
- **Multi-Region Support**: Deploy configurations across multiple geographic regions  
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute AI provider requests across multiple endpoints
- **Caching Strategies**: Optimize performance with intelligent caching
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse with configurable rate limits

### Integration & Automation
- **GitOps Integration**: Version control your configurations alongside code
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Automate configuration deployment
- **Webhook Support**: React to configuration changes with custom automation
- **API-First Design**: Programmatically manage all configurations

## Configuration Management

All enterprise configurations support:

- **Version Control**: Track changes with full revision history
- **Environment Promotion**: Deploy configurations from dev → staging → production
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Quickly revert problematic configurations
- **Configuration Validation**: Automated testing of configuration changes
- **Drift Detection**: Monitor and alert on configuration drift
