description: "Decide between SaaS and Self-Hosted configuration for your Cline Enterprise deployment"
---

Choose the right configuration approach for your organization based on your infrastructure requirements, security needs, and deployment preferences.

## Quick Decision Tree

<Steps>
<Step title="Do you already have AWS/GCP infrastructure?">
**Yes** → Consider Self-Hosted Configuration for deep integration with your existing cloud environment

**No** → SaaS Configuration is faster and requires no infrastructure setup
</Step>

<Step title="Do you need VPC endpoints and private connectivity?">
**Yes** → Self-Hosted Configuration provides full control over network topology

**No** → Either approach works, but SaaS is simpler
</Step>

<Step title="Do you need multi-account AWS setups or custom IAM policies?">
**Yes** → Self-Hosted Configuration required for complex AWS architectures

**No** → SaaS Configuration offers simpler credential management
</Step>

<Step title="Do you prefer web-based configuration or GitOps/YAML?">
**Web-based** → SaaS Configuration uses an intuitive admin console

**GitOps/YAML** → Self-Hosted Configuration integrates with your existing IaC workflows
</Step>

<Step title="What's your setup time expectation?">
**5-10 minutes** → SaaS Configuration is ready immediately

**Hours to days** → Self-Hosted Configuration requires infrastructure deployment
</Step>
</Steps>

## Use Case Examples

### SaaS Configuration Scenarios

**Startup/SMB**
- **Team Size**: 5-20 developers
- **Need**: Quick AI integration without infrastructure overhead
- **Setup**: Configure AWS Bedrock region through web console, team members add AWS credentials
- **Time to Deploy**: 10 minutes

**Mid-Size Company**
- **Team Size**: 20-50 developers across 2-3 teams
- **Need**: Centralized provider management with basic cost controls
- **Setup**: Admin configures LiteLLM proxy endpoint, enforces model selections
- **Time to Deploy**: 30 minutes

### Self-Hosted Configuration Scenarios

**Financial Services Enterprise**
- **Team Size**: 100+ developers
- **Need**: HIPAA compliance, VPC isolation, audit logging
- **Setup**: Multi-account AWS Bedrock with VPC endpoints, CloudTrail, KMS encryption
- **Time to Deploy**: 2-3 days

**Global Technology Company**
- **Team Size**: 500+ developers across 10+ regions
- **Need**: Multi-region deployment, cost allocation by team, custom governance
- **Setup**: Multi-region AWS Bedrock + GCP Vertex with GitOps, custom IAM, budget alerts
- **Time to Deploy**: 1-2 weeks

**Healthcare Organization**
- **Team Size**: 50+ developers
- **Need**: Data residency in EU, complete audit trails, custom encryption
- **Setup**: EU-only deployments with customer-managed encryption keys and detailed logging
- **Time to Deploy**: 3-5 days

## Security Considerations

### SaaS Configuration Security Features
- Standard HTTPS encryption in transit
- AWS credential isolation (credentials stay with individual developers)
- Basic role-based access control
- Activity logging through Cline platform
- Regional compliance (provider region selection)

### Self-Hosted Configuration Security Features  
- Customer-managed encryption keys (KMS)
- Private VPC endpoints (no public internet)
- Custom IAM policies with least privilege
- CloudTrail/Cloud Logging integration
- Zero-trust network architecture
- Custom compliance framework implementation
- Data residency enforcement
- Advanced threat detection integration

## Cost Considerations

### SaaS Configuration Costs
- **Platform Fee**: Cline Enterprise subscription
- **AI Provider Costs**: Pay directly to AI provider (AWS/GCP/etc.)
- **No Infrastructure Costs**: No servers, databases, or networking to maintain
- **Predictable**: Fixed platform fee + usage-based AI costs

### Self-Hosted Configuration Costs
- **Platform Fee**: Cline Enterprise subscription
- **AI Provider Costs**: Pay directly to AI provider (AWS/GCP/etc.)
- **Infrastructure Costs**: 
  - Kubernetes cluster hosting
  - Load balancers and networking
  - Storage and databases
  - Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- **Personnel**: DevOps team to maintain infrastructure
- **Variable**: Depends on scale and architecture complexity

## Migration Path

### Starting with SaaS, Moving to Self-Hosted

Many organizations start with SaaS configuration for quick deployment, then migrate to self-hosted as requirements grow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Start with SaaS">
Deploy quickly with SaaS configuration, establish workflows and patterns
</Step>

<Step title="Assess Requirements">
After 3-6 months, evaluate if you need self-hosted features (VPC, multi-account, etc.)
</Step>

<Step title="Plan Infrastructure">
Design your self-hosted architecture based on learned usage patterns
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy Self-Hosted">
Deploy infrastructure and migrate teams gradually
</Step>

<Step title="Cutover">
Complete migration and decommission SaaS configuration
</Step>
</Steps>

This approach minimizes risk and ensures your self-hosted infrastructure meets actual requirements.
