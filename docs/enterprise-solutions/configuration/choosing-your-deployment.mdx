    - Small to medium teams (5-50 developers)
    - Quick deployment needs
    - Limited DevOps resources
    - Standard security requirements
    - Single region deployments
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Self-Hosted Configuration" icon="server" href="/enterprise-solutions/configuration/infrastructure-configuration/overview">
    ### Full Infrastructure Control
    
    ✅ Your own AWS/GCP/K8s  
    ✅ VPC endpoints & private connectivity  
    ✅ Multi-account setups  
    ✅ Advanced compliance & audit  
    ✅ GitOps workflows
    
    **Best for:**
