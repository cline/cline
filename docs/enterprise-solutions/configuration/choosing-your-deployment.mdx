Choose the right configuration approach for your organization. Most teams start with SaaS for quick deployment, while enterprises with complex requirements opt for self-hosted infrastructure.

## Quick Decision Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Do you have existing cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP)?">
**Yes** → Self-Hosted gives you deep integration with your existing environment

**No** → SaaS requires no infrastructure and is ready in minutes
</Step>

<Step title="How quickly do you need to deploy?">
**Within hours** → SaaS Configuration (5-10 minutes setup)

**Can wait days/weeks** → Self-Hosted Configuration (full infrastructure deployment)
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Rule of thumb:** Teams under 50 developers typically choose SaaS. Enterprises with 50+ developers and complex security requirements choose Self-Hosted.
</Tip>

## Migration Path

<Note>
Most organizations start with SaaS configuration for quick deployment, then migrate to self-hosted later as requirements grow. This minimizes risk and ensures your infrastructure meets actual usage patterns.
