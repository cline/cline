## Choosing the Right Configuration

### Use SaaS Configuration When:
- **Quick Setup**: You need to get your team up and running quickly
- **Centralized Management**: You want simple, cloud-based provider management
- **Standard Requirements**: Your organization has typical security and compliance needs
- **Small to Medium Teams**: You're managing dozens to hundreds of users

### Use Self-Hosted Configuration When:
- **Enterprise Security**: You need advanced security features and compliance controls
- **Complex Infrastructure**: You have existing AWS/GCP infrastructure to integrate with
- **Custom Workflows**: You need custom rules, workflows, and automation
- **Large Organizations**: You're managing hundreds to thousands of users
- **Air-Gapped Environments**: You need on-premises or restricted network deployment

## Configuration Comparison

| Feature | SaaS Configuration | Self-Hosted Configuration |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Simple | Advanced |
| **Deployment Time** | Minutes | Days to Weeks |
| **Infrastructure Required** | None | AWS/GCP/Azure |
| **Compliance Features** | Basic | Advanced |
| **Custom Rules** | No | Yes |
| **Multi-Account Support** | No | Yes |
| **VPC Integration** | No | Yes |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher |

## Available Providers

Both configuration approaches support the same core inference providers:

  <Card title="AWS Bedrock" icon="aws">
    Enterprise AI models with AWS infrastructure integration and security features.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="LiteLLM" icon="layer-group">
    Unified proxy for accessing 100+ AI models through a single interface.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Google Vertex AI" icon="google">
    Google Cloud's AI platform with advanced ML capabilities and global infrastructure.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

The main difference lies in how these providers are configured and managed within your organization's infrastructure and security requirements.
