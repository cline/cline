<Warning>
**SaaS Configuration Path**

This section is for teams using **Cline's hosted service** at [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot). Configuration is done through a web-based admin console with simple dropdown menus and settings.

**Need self-hosted infrastructure?** See [Self-Hosted Configuration](/enterprise-solutions/configuration/infrastructure-configuration/overview) for VPC endpoints, multi-account AWS, compliance frameworks, and deep infrastructure control including YAML configs, Kubernetes/Helm deployments, and advanced security features.
</Warning>

SaaS Provider Configuration allows administrators to centrally configure AI providers for their entire organization through the Cline hosted admin console. This approach ensures consistent provider access, security policies, and cost management across all team members without requiring individual developer setup or infrastructure deployment.

## How Remote Configuration Works

Remote configuration operates through Cline's hosted service at [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot), where administrators can:

## Supported Providers

Cline supports remote configuration for the following AI providers:

### **Cline**
- **Use Case**: Organizations using Cline's native provider with centralized API key management
- **Configuration**: API provider selection, model access
- **Member Setup**: No individual API keys needed - fully managed by organization

### **Amazon Bedrock**
- **Use Case**: Organizations using AWS infrastructure
- **Configuration**: Region selection, VPC endpoints, cross-region inference, prompt caching
- **Member Setup**: AWS credential configuration in VS Code

### **LiteLLM**
- **Use Case**: Organizations requiring multi-model access through a unified proxy
- **Configuration**: Proxy endpoint, authentication, model routing
- **Member Setup**: API key or endpoint configuration in VS Code (or centralized with Master Key)

### **Google Vertex AI**
- **Use Case**: Organizations using Google Cloud Platform
- **Configuration**: Project ID, region selection, model access
- **Member Setup**: Service account or credential configuration in VS Code

## SaaS vs. Self-Hosted Configuration

<Note>
**Understanding the Difference**

- **SaaS Provider Configuration** (this section): Simple cloud-based setup via app.cline.bot admin console - no infrastructure required
- **Self-Hosted Configuration**: Deep infrastructure setup with VPC, multi-account, compliance features, YAML configs, and Kubernetes deployment

Choose SaaS configuration for quick organizational setup. Choose self-hosted configuration for complex security, compliance, and multi-environment requirements.
</Note>

## Configuration Process

The typical remote configuration process follows these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Administrator Setup">
Access the Cline admin console and configure the desired AI provider with organization-wide settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Automatic Distribution">
Provider configuration is automatically distributed to all organization members signed into Cline.
</Step>

<Step title="Member Credential Setup">
Team members add their individual credentials (API keys, AWS profiles, etc.) to connect to the configured provider.
</Step>

<Step title="Immediate Access">
Once credentials are configured, members can immediately start using the AI provider through Cline.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Benefits of Remote Configuration

### **For Administrators**
- **Centralized Control**: Manage all provider settings from one location
- **Security Compliance**: Ensure consistent security policies across the organization
- **Easy Updates**: Change provider settings organization-wide instantly

### **For Team Members**  
- **Simplified Setup**: No need to research provider configuration options
- **Consistent Experience**: Same models and features available to everyone
- **Quick Onboarding**: Get started immediately with pre-configured providers
- **Focus on Development**: Spend time coding instead of configuring AI providers

## Getting Started

To get started with provider remote configuration:

1. **Choose Your Provider**: Select the AI provider that best fits your organization's needs and existing infrastructure
2. **Admin Configuration**: Follow the provider-specific admin configuration guide
3. **Member Onboarding**: Have team members complete the provider-specific member configuration
4. **Start Developing**: Begin using Cline with centrally managed AI provider access
