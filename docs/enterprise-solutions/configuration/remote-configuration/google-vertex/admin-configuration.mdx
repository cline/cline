<Info>
**Configuration Path: SaaS**

This guide is for the web-based admin console at [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot). For self-hosted infrastructure setup with VPC controls, custom IAM policies, and advanced compliance features, see [Google Vertex AI Self-Hosted Configuration](/enterprise-solutions/configuration/infrastructure-configuration/providers/google-vertex/overview).
</Info>

As an administrator, you can add Google Vertex AI as the organization-wide LLM provider for all Cline users through the hosted admin console. This centralized approach ensures consistent access to Google's advanced AI models while maintaining your organization's project boundaries, regional compliance requirements, and cost controls through Google Cloud's enterprise billing.

## Before You Begin

To get started with setting up Google Vertex AI as your organization's LLM provider, you'll need a few items in place.

**Administrator access to the Cline Admin console**  
You need admin privileges to enforce provider settings across your organization. If you can navigate to **Settings → Cline Settings** in the admin console at [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot), you have the right access level.

<Info>
**Quick Check**: Try accessing the settings page now. If you can see the provider configuration options, you're good to go.
</Info>

**Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled**  
You need a Google Cloud project with the Vertex AI API enabled and appropriate models accessible.

<Note>
If you haven't set up Google Cloud or Vertex AI yet, check the [Enterprise Infrastructure Setup](/enterprise-solutions/configuration/infrastructure-configuration/providers/google-vertex/overview) for comprehensive deployment guidance.
</Note>

**Project configuration details**  
You'll need your Google Cloud project ID and preferred region for Vertex AI model access.

<Tip>
Ensure your Google Cloud project has the necessary quotas and permissions for the Vertex AI models you want to make available to your team.

## Configuration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Access Cline Settings">
Navigate to [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot) and sign in with your administrator account. Go to **Settings → Cline Settings**.

<Info>
You should see the provider configuration options if you have the correct admin access level.
</Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Remote Provider Configuration">
Toggle on **Enable settings** to reveal the remote provider configuration options. This allows you to enforce provider settings across your organization.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Google Vertex AI as the API Provider">
Open the **API Provider** dropdown menu and select **Google Vertex AI**. This will open the Vertex AI configuration panel where you'll configure all your organization-wide settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Vertex AI Settings">
The configuration panel includes several settings that control how Vertex AI works for your organization:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Project ID (required)">
Enter your Google Cloud project ID where Vertex AI is enabled. This project will be used for all AI model requests from your organization members.

<Tip>
Use a dedicated project for AI workloads to better track usage and costs. Ensure the project has sufficient quotas for your team's expected usage.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Region (required)">
Select the Google Cloud region where your Vertex AI models should be accessed. Common options include `us-central1`, `us-east4`, or `europe-west4`.

[View Google Cloud Regions](https://cloud.google.com/docs/geography-and-regions)

<Note>
Choose a region close to your team's location for optimal performance. Some models may not be available in all regions.
</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Model Access (optional)">
Configure which Vertex AI models are available to your organization. You can allow access to all available models or restrict to specific model families.

Available model categories:
- **Gemini models**: Latest multimodal capabilities
- **Custom models**: Your organization's fine-tuned models
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="Cost Controls (optional)">
Set up usage monitoring and budget controls if desired:
- **Project-level budgets**: Monitor spending across the project
- **Per-user quotas**: Limit individual team member usage
- **Model-specific limits**: Control access to expensive models
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Save Configuration">
After configuring your settings, close the provider configuration panel and click **Save** on the settings page to persist your changes.

Once saved, all organization members signed into the Cline extension will automatically use Google Vertex AI with your configured settings. They won't be able to select other providers or switch to their personal Cline accounts.

<Warning>
Members can't switch to personal Cline accounts or join other organizations once remote configuration is enabled. This ensures consistent provider usage across your team.
</Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

To verify the configuration:

1. Check that the provider shows as "Google Vertex AI" in the Enabled provider field
2. Confirm the settings persist after refreshing the page
3. Test with a member account to ensure they see only Vertex AI as a provider
4. Verify that the configured models are available in the model dropdown

## Model Management

### Available Model Families
The models available through your remote Vertex AI configuration include:

**Gemini Models:**
- **Gemini Pro**: Advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities
- **Gemini Pro Vision**: Image understanding and generation
- **Gemini Ultra**: Most capable model for complex tasks

**Specialized Models:**
- **Embedding models**: For semantic search and similarity
- **Custom models**: Your organization's fine-tuned variants

### Model Configuration
Configure available models in your organization through:

1. **Google Cloud Console**: Enable model access at the project level
2. **Remote Configuration**: Restrict which models are visible to your team
3. **Quota Management**: Control usage limits per model family
4. **Regional Availability**: Some models may only be available in specific regions

## Cost Management

### Usage Monitoring
Monitor Vertex AI usage through Google Cloud:

- **Cloud Billing**: Track costs by project and model usage
- **Vertex AI Quotas**: Monitor request and token consumption
- **Custom Dashboards**: Create usage analytics for your team
- **Budget Alerts**: Set up notifications for spending thresholds

### Cost Controls
Configure spending controls through the admin console and Google Cloud:

- **Project Budgets**: Set organization-wide spending limits
- **Model-Specific Quotas**: Limit access to expensive models
- **User Attribution**: Track usage by individual team members
- **Automatic Scaling**: Configure quotas that adjust based on usage patterns

## Regional Compliance

### Data Residency
Ensure compliance with data residency requirements:

- **Regional Model Access**: Choose regions that comply with your data governance policies
- **Data Processing Locations**: Understand where your data is processed
- **Cross-Border Transfers**: Configure appropriate regions for international teams
- **Compliance Frameworks**: Leverage Google Cloud's compliance certifications

### Security Controls
Configure security settings for enterprise compliance:

- **VPC Service Controls**: Restrict API access to authorized networks
- **IAM Policies**: Control fine-grained access to Vertex AI resources
- **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive request and response logging
- **Encryption**: Ensure data is encrypted in transit and at rest

## Troubleshooting

**Members don't see the configured provider**  
Ensure you clicked Save after closing the configuration panel. Verify the member account belongs to the correct organization and that your Google Cloud project has Vertex AI API enabled.

**Project access errors**  
Verify the project ID is correct and that Vertex AI API is enabled. Check that the project has appropriate billing configured and hasn't exceeded quotas.

**Regional availability issues**  
Confirm the selected region supports the models you want to use. Some newer models may only be available in specific regions.

**Authentication failures**  
Verify that team members have appropriate Google Cloud credentials configured. Check that service accounts have the necessary Vertex AI permissions.

**Model access errors**  
Ensure the models are enabled in your Google Cloud project. Check that project quotas are sufficient and that billing is properly configured.

**Configuration changes don't persist**
