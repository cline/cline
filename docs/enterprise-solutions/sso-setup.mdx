## Overview
Cline Enterprise integrates with your identity provider (IdP) via **WorkOS AuthKit** for SSO.

This page describes, at a high level, how SSO is set up for Cline Enterprise using WorkOS AuthKit.

If you haven’t completed initial onboarding, start with [Onboarding](/enterprise-solutions/onboarding).

## Where setup happens
SSO setup spans three places:

1) **Cline Dashboard (app.cline.bot)**
- Where you sign in and verify SSO works for your organization.

2) **WorkOS dashboard**
- Where your IdP connection is configured (AuthKit → Connections).

3) **Your Identity Provider (Okta / Entra / Google Workspace / Keycloak, etc.)**
- Where users, groups, and login policy are managed.

<Info>
This page intentionally avoids backend deployment/internal configuration details. If you’re onboarding to Cline Enterprise and need deployment-specific configuration values (like redirect URLs), contact your onboarding/support channel.
</Info>

## Using the Cline Dashboard
Use the Cline Dashboard at https://app.cline.bot to:
- complete sign-in and onboarding flows
- verify users can authenticate via SSO

<Info>
The dashboard includes SSO-related callback routes used during authentication (for example, `/auth/callback` and `/auth/sso-callback`).

## Configure your IdP connection in WorkOS
To connect your IdP to Cline Enterprise, configure your identity provider in **WorkOS AuthKit**:

1. In the WorkOS dashboard, go to **AuthKit → Connections**
2. Click **Add Connection**
3. Select your identity provider (e.g., Okta, Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD, Google Workspace, Generic SAML/OIDC)
4. Follow the provider-specific instructions in WorkOS

WorkOS’s UI and required fields vary by provider. For details, follow WorkOS documentation:
- https://workos.com/docs/authkit/sso

## Keycloak note (IdP compatibility)
Cline Enterprise’s default SSO integration is **via WorkOS** (there is no direct Keycloak integration in the code we inspected).

If you use **Keycloak** as your IdP, the supported path is to configure Keycloak in WorkOS as a **Generic SAML** or **Generic OIDC** provider (using the settings WorkOS requests for those provider types).

## Verification
After configuring WorkOS:

1) Attempt an SSO sign-in from https://app.cline.bot.
2) Confirm the sign-in completes (you are redirected back successfully).

## Troubleshooting
- **Redirect URI mismatch**: confirm the redirect/callback URL configured in WorkOS matches what was provided during your Cline Enterprise onboarding.

For additional troubleshooting guidance, refer to WorkOS documentation:
