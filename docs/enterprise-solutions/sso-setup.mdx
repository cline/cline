## Overview
Cline Enterprise integrates with your identity provider (IdP) via **WorkOS AuthKit** for SSO.

This page documents the **verified configuration inputs** required by the Cline Enterprise backend (Core Platform) to enable WorkOS-based authentication.

If you haven’t completed initial onboarding, start with [Onboarding](/enterprise-solutions/onboarding).

## What you configure
There are two parts:

1) **WorkOS dashboard**
- Create/configure an AuthKit connection for your IdP (Okta, Microsoft Entra ID/Azure AD, Google Workspace, or any SAML/OIDC IdP supported by WorkOS).
- Configure an AuthKit redirect URL (callback) and webhook signing secret.

2) **Your Cline Enterprise backend**
- Provide WorkOS credentials and secrets via environment variables.

## Required environment variables (Cline Enterprise backend)
The Cline Enterprise backend expects the following WorkOS configuration values (as environment variables).

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `WORKOS_API_KEY` | Authenticates the backend to WorkOS APIs. |
| `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` | Identifies your WorkOS AuthKit client. |
| `WORKOS_COOKIE_SIGNING_SECRET` | Used to create/verify **sealed sessions** (signed session cookie payloads). |
| `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` | The backend callback URL that WorkOS redirects to after SSO completes. |
| `WORKOS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Used to validate the `WorkOS-Signature` header for WorkOS webhooks. |

<Info>
These values are referenced by the core-platform backend configuration (`WorkOSConfig`) and are required for WorkOS-based SSO.
</Info>

## Redirect URI (callback URL)
WorkOS needs an exact **Redirect URI** for your deployment.

- In WorkOS, set the AuthKit redirect/callback URL to your backend’s auth callback endpoint.
- In your backend configuration, set `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` to the same value.

<Info>
The exact URL depends on your deployment hostname. In core-platform’s production/staging Helm values, the callback path is `/api/v1/auth/callback` (shown as an example), but you should use the hostname for your environment.
</Info>

## Webhooks
Cline Enterprise validates WorkOS webhooks using the `WORKOS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

WorkOS webhooks are used for syncing organization-related events. In the current core-platform implementation:
- Organization create/update/delete events are handled.
- Membership **role updates** are handled.

## WorkOS dashboard setup
WorkOS’s UI and required fields vary by IdP.

Follow WorkOS’s official setup instructions for your provider:
- WorkOS AuthKit SSO docs: https://workos.com/docs/authkit/sso

## Keycloak note (IdP compatibility)
Cline Enterprise’s default SSO integration is **via WorkOS** (there is no direct Keycloak integration in the code we inspected).

If you use **Keycloak** as your IdP, the supported path is to configure Keycloak in WorkOS as a **Generic SAML** or **Generic OIDC** provider (using the settings WorkOS requests for those provider types).

## Verification
After configuring WorkOS + your backend:

1) Attempt an SSO sign-in from your Cline Enterprise UI.
2) Confirm the sign-in completes (redirects back successfully).
3) If you enabled webhooks, confirm webhook signature validation succeeds and org/member events are received.

## Troubleshooting
- **Redirect URI mismatch**: ensure WorkOS’s configured redirect URI exactly matches `WORKOS_REDIRECT_URI` (including scheme, host, path).
- **Webhook signature failures**: ensure `WORKOS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches the WorkOS webhook signing secret and the `WorkOS-Signature` header is present.

For additional troubleshooting guidance, refer to WorkOS documentation:
