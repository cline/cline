Cline Enterprise brings centralized governance to the same open-source architecture that millions of developers already use. Your code stays in your environment, you use your own inference at your negotiated rates, and you get the security and observability capabilities that platform teams need for org-wide deployment.

## What You Get

It delivers five core capabilities that platform teams need for production deployment. Each addresses a specific requirement for scaling AI coding across your organization.

### Security by Design

Your code never leaves your environment. Cline processes everything locally - no uploads, no indexing, no training on your data.

### Bring Your Own Inference

Use your existing cloud contracts and negotiated rates. Most AI tools force you to buy inference through them with markup. Cline connects directly to your providers.

Connect to any inference provider:
- AWS Bedrock
- Google Vertex AI
- Azure OpenAI
- Anthropic direct
- OpenAI direct
- Cerebras
- Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Switch models instantly as new ones release. Use Claude Sonnet 4.5 as your daily driver, GPT-5 for complex refactoring, open-source models for simple tasks. Your existing cloud credits and startup program contracts now cover AI coding. We handle the agent loop. You handle the inference. No markup, no vendor lock-in.

### Governance at Scale

Platform teams need central control when thousands of developers use AI. Individual API keys scattered across laptops create security risks and cost overruns.

Enterprise governance provides:
- **SSO authentication**: Corporate credentials instead of personal API keys
- **Role-based access control**: Fine-grained permissions per team and project
- **Model and tool controls**: Govern which models and tools each team accesses
- **Remote configuration**: Manage settings for all developers from one dashboard
- **Full audit logging**: Every AI interaction tracked with detailed logs

Configure once, deploy everywhere. Developers work how they prefer while you maintain control.

### Complete Observability

Export logs to your existing observability stack. Track usage, costs, and performance across all teams.

- **OpenTelemetry export**: Direct integration with Datadog, Grafana, Splunk
- **Real-time analytics**: Track adoption, performance, and patterns
- **Cost breakdown**: See exactly what each team spends on which models
- **JSON output**: Build custom dashboards in your existing tools

The same observability standards you require for production systems.

## Deployment

Cline Enterprise connects securely to your infrastructure. Deploy in cloud environments, on-premises, or air-gapped networks. Configure to work with your existing security policies and compliance requirements.

Rolling out to your organization:
1. Configure Cline Core to connect to your infrastructure
2. Set SSO, RBAC, and governance policies
3. Deploy to developers via your existing software distribution
4. Monitor usage through your observability tools

## Next Steps

- Review [security architecture](/enterprise-solutions/security-concerns)
- Configure [cloud provider setup](/provider-config/aws-bedrock/api-key) (AWS Bedrock, Vertex AI, Azure)
- Set up [MCP servers](/mcp/mcp-overview) for custom tooling
- Add [custom instructions](/features/cline-rules) for your codebase

Schedule a walkthrough to see how Cline Enterprise fits your infrastructure. We'll work with your security and compliance requirements to deploy in your environment.
