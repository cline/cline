## Cline Telemetry

Cline includes opt-in telemetry for anonymous usage tracking:

- Feature usage patterns
- Task completion rates  
- Error occurrences
- Performance metrics

Users can enable or disable telemetry in Cline settings. All data is anonymous and does not include code content, file paths, or sensitive information.

See [Cline Telemetry](/enterprise-solutions/monitoring/telemetry) for configuration details.

## OpenTelemetry Integration

For advanced monitoring needs, Cline supports OpenTelemetry's OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) for exporting metrics and logs to your own infrastructure.

This allows you to:
- Export telemetry to your existing observability platforms
- Integrate with tools like Datadog, New Relic, or Grafana Cloud
- Maintain full control over your monitoring data
- Aggregate metrics across your organization

<Note>
OpenTelemetry integration is **optional** and requires additional configuration. Most users don't need this feature.
</Note>

See [OpenTelemetry](/enterprise-solutions/monitoring/opentelemetry) for setup instructions.

## Use Cases
