Cline includes telemetry to help understand usage patterns and improve the product. Users can control whether to share this data.

## What is Cline Telemetry?

Telemetry captures anonymous usage events such as:

- Features used (which tools, commands, workflows)
- Task completion rates
- Error occurrences
- Performance metrics

<Info>
All telemetry data is **anonymous** and does not include code content, file contents, or other sensitive information.
</Info>

## User Controls

### Enabling/Disabling Cline Telemetry

Individual users can control telemetry through Cline settings:

1. Open Cline settings
2. Find "Cline Telemetry" toggle
3. Enable or disable as preferred

Changes take effect immediately.

### What Gets Collected

When telemetry is enabled, Cline captures:

</AccordionGroup>

### What Doesn't Get Collected

Cline Telemetry **never** includes:

## Enterprise Configuration

Administrators can set default telemetry state through remote configuration:

```json
{
  "telemetryEnabled": true
}
```

<Note>
Even with enterprise configuration, individual users can still disable Cline Telemetry in their local settings.
</Note>

## Advanced Monitoring

For organizations needing detailed monitoring, Cline supports optional OpenTelemetry integration to export telemetry data to your own observability systems.

See [Enterprise Monitoring](/enterprise-solutions/monitoring/overview) for details on available monitoring options.

## Privacy

Cline's telemetry is designed with privacy in mind:

## Why Telemetry Matters

Anonymous usage data helps:

- **Identify bugs**: Discover issues affecting users
- **Prioritize features**: Focus on most-used capabilities
- **Improve performance**: Find and fix slow operations
- **Enhance reliability**: Track and reduce error rates
