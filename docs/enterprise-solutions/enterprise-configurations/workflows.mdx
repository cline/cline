## Advanced Workflow Features

### Conditional Logic

Use conditions to control workflow execution:

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "smart-deployment-workflow"
    steps:
      - name: "analyze-changes"
        type: "code-analysis"
        output: "analysis_result"
        
      - name: "fast-track-deployment"
        type: "deployment"
        conditions:
          - "{{ analysis_result.risk_level == 'low' }}"
          - "{{ analysis_result.test_coverage > 90 }}"
        config:
          skip_manual_approval: true
          
      - name: "full-review-process"  
        type: "approval-chain"
        conditions:
          - "{{ analysis_result.risk_level == 'high' }}"
        config:
          approvers: ["security-team", "architecture-team"]
```

### Parallel Execution

Run steps in parallel for better performance:

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "parallel-quality-checks"
    steps:
      - name: "quality-checks"
        type: "parallel"
        steps:
          - name: "lint-check"
            type: "code-analysis"
            config:
              tool: "eslint"
              
          - name: "security-scan"
            type: "security-analysis"
            config:
              tool: "semgrep"
              
          - name: "dependency-audit"
            type: "dependency-check"
            config:
              tool: "npm-audit"
              
      - name: "aggregate-results"
        type: "result-aggregation"
        depends_on: ["quality-checks"]
```

### Error Handling and Retry Logic

Handle failures gracefully:

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "resilient-deployment"
    steps:
      - name: "deploy-application"
        type: "deployment"
        retry_policy:
          max_attempts: 3
          backoff_strategy: "exponential"
          retry_on: ["timeout", "connection_error"]
          
        error_handling:
          on_failure: "rollback"
          notification: "pagerduty"
          
    error_handling:
      global_timeout: "30m"
      on_timeout: "cancel"
      cleanup_steps:
        - name: "cleanup-resources"
          type: "resource-cleanup"
```

## Enterprise Workflow Orchestration

### Multi-Environment Workflows

Manage workflows across different environments:

```yaml
# enterprise-deployment-pipeline.yaml
name: "enterprise-deployment-pipeline"

environments:
  development:
    auto_deploy: true
    approvals_required: 0
    tests: ["unit", "integration"]
    
  staging:
    auto_deploy: true
    approvals_required: 1
    tests: ["unit", "integration", "e2e"]
    approvers: ["tech-lead"]
    
  production:
    auto_deploy: false
    approvals_required: 3
    tests: ["unit", "integration", "e2e", "performance"]
    approvers: ["tech-lead", "security-team", "change-board"]

workflow:
  - name: "deploy-to-dev"
    trigger:
      type: "code-push"
      branch: "develop"
    environment: "development"
    
  - name: "promote-to-staging"
    trigger:  
      type: "deployment-success"
      environment: "development"
    environment: "staging"
    
  - name: "deploy-to-production"
    trigger:
      type: "manual"
      environment: "staging"
    environment: "production"
```

### Workflow Templates

Create reusable workflow templates:

```yaml
# templates/code-review-template.yaml
template:
  name: "code-review-template"
  parameters:
    - name: "reviewers"
      type: "array"
      required: true
    - name: "auto_merge"
      type: "boolean"
      default: false
      
  steps:
    - name: "create-pull-request"
      type: "integration"
      service: "github"
      config:
        reviewers: "{{ parameters.reviewers }}"
        
    - name: "automated-checks"
      type: "parallel"
      steps:
        - name: "lint"
          type: "code-analysis"
        - name: "test"
          type: "testing"
        - name: "security"
          type: "security-analysis"
          
    - name: "merge-if-approved"
      type: "integration"
      service: "github"
      config:
        action: "merge"
        conditions:
          - all_reviews_approved: true
          - all_checks_passed: true
          - auto_merge: "{{ parameters.auto_merge }}"
```

Use templates in workflows:

```yaml
workflows:
  - name: "feature-review"
    extends: "code-review-template"
    parameters:
      reviewers: ["senior-dev-1", "senior-dev-2"]
      auto_merge: true
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Workflow Metrics

Track workflow performance and success rates:

```yaml
# monitoring/workflow-metrics.yaml

  - name: "workflow_execution_duration"
    type: "histogram"
    labels: ["workflow_name", "environment", "status"]
    
  - name: "workflow_success_rate"
    type: "gauge"
    labels: ["workflow_name", "environment"]

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design
1. **Keep Steps Atomic**: Each step should do one thing well
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Make workflow and step names self-documenting
3. **Plan for Failures**: Include error handling and rollback procedures
4. **Optimize for Speed**: Use parallel execution where possible
5. **Version Your Workflows**: Track changes and enable rollbacks

### Security & Compliance
1. **Least Privilege**: Workflows should have minimal required permissions
2. **Secret Management**: Use secure secret storage and rotation
3. **Audit Everything**: Log all workflow executions and decisions
4. **Approval Gates**: Implement appropriate approval requirements
5. **Access Controls**: Restrict who can create and modify workflows

### Performance & Scalability
1. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate timeouts and resource constraints
2. **Queue Management**: Implement proper queuing for high-volume workflows
3. **Caching**: Cache expensive operations where appropriate
4. **Monitoring**: Track performance metrics and optimize slow workflows
5. **Load Testing**: Test workflows under realistic load conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow Not Triggering**:
```bash
# Check workflow configuration
cline-enterprise workflows validate workflow-name

# Test trigger conditions
cline-enterprise workflows test-trigger --workflow workflow-name --event event.json

# Check workflow status
cline-enterprise workflows status --workflow workflow-name
```

**Steps Failing**:
```bash
# View workflow execution logs
cline-enterprise workflows logs --execution exec-12345

# Retry failed step
cline-enterprise workflows retry --execution exec-12345 --step step-name

# Debug step configuration
cline-enterprise workflows debug --workflow workflow-name --step step-name
```

**Integration Issues**:
```bash
# Test integration connectivity
cline-enterprise integrations test --service github

# View integration logs
cline-enterprise integrations logs --service jira --timeframe 1h

# Refresh integration credentials
cline-enterprise integrations refresh --service slack
```

Enterprise Workflows provide powerful automation capabilities that scale with your organization. Start with simple workflows and gradually build more sophisticated automation as your team's needs evolve.
