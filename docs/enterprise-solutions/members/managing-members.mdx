## Adding Members

To invite someone to your organization, you must have an open seat available on your organization.

1.  Navigate to the **Members** tab in your dashboard.
2.  Click the **Add Members** button.
3.  Enter one or more email addresses, separated by commas.
4.  Select a role for the new member(s). It's best practice to start with the "Member" role unless you know they need admin privileges.
5.  Click **Send Invitation**.

Invited users will receive an email with a link to join. You can cancel a pending invitation at any time by clicking the trash icon next to the user's email in the 'Pending Invites' section.

<Tip>
  **Managing Users at Scale**

  When inviting a large number of users, you can paste a comma-separated list of emails directly into the invitation field. While role changes and removals are performed individually, this bulk invitation feature helps streamline the onboarding process for entire teams.

## Editing Member Roles

As your team's needs change, you can adjust member roles directly from the dashboard.

- Find the member in your list.
- Under the "Role" column, click the dropdown menu.
- Select their new role. The change takes effect immediately.

Refer to the [Roles Overview](/enterprise-solutions/members/overview) for a detailed breakdown of what each role can do.

## Removing Members

Removing a member immediately revokes their access to all organization-specific resources, including shared API keys and configurations.

1.  Go to the **Members Dashboard**.
2.  Find the member in the list and click the red trash icon (<Icon icon="trash" iconType="solid" />).
3.  Confirm the removal when prompted.

## Troubleshooting Invitations

If an invited user is having trouble joining, check these common issues:

-   **Invitation Not Received**: Ask the user to check their spam or junk mail folder. If it's not there, cancel the pending invitation and try sending it again, verifying the email address is correct.

-   **"Invalid Domain" Error**: The user's email address must belong to a domain that has been verified for your organization. Work with your IT administrator to ensure the necessary domains are configured.
