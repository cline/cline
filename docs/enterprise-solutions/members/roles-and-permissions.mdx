Choosing the right role for each member is crucial for maintaining security and ensuring your team can work effectively. This guide provides a detailed breakdown of the available roles, their specific permissions, and best practices for managing your organization.

## Role Definitions

Here’s a summary of the available roles and their intended use cases.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Owner" icon="user-crown">
    **Best for:** The primary account holder or a small number of designated leaders.

    Owners have unrestricted access to all settings, including billing, member management, and security configurations. To maintain tight control over the organization, the number of Owners should be kept to a minimum.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-gear">
    **Best for:** Team leads or IT administrators who need to manage users and configurations.

    Admins can invite, edit, and remove members, as well as manage provider configurations. They have broad access but cannot manage billing or change the Owner. This is a suitable role for trusted team managers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Member" icon="user">
    **Best for:** Most developers and individual contributors.

    Members can use Cline with the organization's shared resources but cannot change any settings or view other users' activity. This is the safest default role for new users.

## Role Management Best Practices

Effective role management is fundamental to securing your organization.

-   **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege**: Always assign the role with the minimum necessary permissions. Most users should be **Members**. Grant **Admin** rights only to those who are responsible for user management or technical configuration.

-   **Limit the Number of Owners**: The **Owner** role should be reserved for one or two key individuals who control the account and billing. This centralization of power prevents accidental or malicious changes to critical settings.

-   **Regularly Audit Roles**: Periodically review the list of Admins and Owners to ensure the assigned roles are still appropriate. When a team member's responsibilities change, adjust their role accordingly.

## Identity Providers and Domain Verification

For a user to successfully join and sign in to your organization, two conditions must be met:
1.  Their email must be managed by your organization's verified **Identity Provider (IDP)**, such as Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, or AWS.
2.  Your organization must have a **verified domain** with a provider like Google or Microsoft.

This ensures that only authenticated users from your company can access your Cline organization.

## Seat Management and Invitations

Each user in your organization, regardless of role, consumes one seat from your license.

-   When an invitation is sent, a seat is considered "pending."
-   If an invited user does not accept, the invitation can be revoked to free up the seat.
-   Removing a member from the organization immediately frees up a seat.

Now that you understand the different roles and how to manage them, you can proceed to [managing your members](/enterprise-solutions/members/managing-members) in the dashboard.
