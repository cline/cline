Effective member management is essential for maintaining security and enabling your team to work productively. This guide covers everything you need to know about roles, permissions, and day-to-day member administration.

## Understanding Roles

Choose the right role for each team member to balance security with productivity. Here's what each role is designed for:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Owner" icon="crown" color="#9D4EDD">
    **Primary account holder**
    
    Unrestricted access to all settings including billing, security, and ownership transfer. Keep this limited to 1-2 key leaders.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-gear" color="#7209B7">
    **Team leads & IT managers**
    
    Can manage users and configure providers. Ideal for trusted managers who need operational control without billing access.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Member" icon="user" color="#560BAD">
    **Developers & contributors**
    
    Can use Cline with shared resources but cannot change settings. The safest default for most team members.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Permissions Matrix

Understand exactly what each role can do with this comprehensive permissions breakdown:

| Permission | Member | Admin | Owner |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **General Usage** | | | |
| Use Cline | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Access Shared API Providers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| | | | |
| **Member Management** | | | |
| View Members | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Invite New Members | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Edit Member Roles | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Remove Members | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Remove Admins | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| | | | |
| **Configuration** | | | |
| Configure API Providers | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage Security Settings | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| | | | |
| **Billing & Ownership** | | | |
| View Billing Information | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Manage Subscription | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Transfer Ownership | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

<Note>
**Quick Reference:** Most users should be **Members**. Grant **Admin** only to those managing users or configs. Reserve **Owner** for 1-2 account leaders.
</Note>

## Member Management Tasks

    3. **Invitation Status**
       - Invited users will receive an email with a join link
       - Pending invitations show in your member list with "Pending" status
       - Each pending invitation holds one seat from your license
    
    <Tip>
    **Bulk Invitations:** Need to add multiple users? Contact support@cline.bot for assistance with bulk invite CSV imports.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Editing Roles">
    ### Changing Member Permissions
    
    1. **Locate the Member**
       - Navigate to the Members page
       - Find the user you want to modify
    
    2. **Change Role**
       - Click the dropdown next to their current role
       - Select the new role from the menu
       - Confirm the change
    
    3. **Effective Immediately**
       - Role changes take effect instantly
       - The user may need to sign out and back in to see updated permissions
    
    <Warning>
    **Admin to Member:** Downgrading an Admin to Member will immediately revoke their ability to manage users and configurations. Ensure they no longer need these permissions.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Removing Members">
    ### Offboarding Team Members
    
    1. **Access Member List**
       - Navigate to your organization's Members page
       - Locate the user to remove
    
    2. **Remove User**
       - Click the menu icon (⋮) next to their name
       - Select "Remove from Organization"
       - Confirm the removal
    
    3. **Immediate Effects**
       - User loses access to the organization immediately
       - Their seat is freed and can be assigned to someone else
       - Audit logs are preserved for compliance
    
    <Info>
    **Data Retention:** Removing a member does not delete their historical activity logs. All audit trails remain intact for compliance purposes.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Revoking Invites">
    ### Canceling Pending Invitations
    
    If an invited user hasn't accepted yet, you can revoke the invitation:
    
    1. Find the pending invitation in your Members list
    2. Click "Revoke Invitation"
    3. The seat is immediately freed for another user
    
    This is useful when:
    - The wrong email was used
    - The user no longer needs access
    - You need to reassign the seat urgently
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Identity & Access Requirements

For users to successfully join your organization, two conditions must be met:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verified Identity Provider">
    Your organization must use a verified **Identity Provider (IDP)** such as:
    - Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
    - Okta
    - Google Workspace
    - AWS IAM Identity Center
    
    Users must authenticate through your IDP to access the organization.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Domain Verification">
    Your organization must have a **verified domain**. You'll need to verify ownership of your domain through your domain provider (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare).
    
    Only users with email addresses from verified domains can join.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
These requirements ensure that only authenticated users from your company can access your Cline organization, preventing unauthorized access.
</Note>

## Seat Management

Understanding how seats work helps you manage your license effectively:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Seats Are Calculated" icon="chair">
    - Each user (Owner, Admin, or Member) consumes **one seat**
    - Pending invitations also hold one seat
    - Removing a member or revoking an invite immediately frees the seat
    - Your license determines the maximum number of seats available
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="When Seats Are Used" icon="user-plus">
    A seat is consumed when:
    - You send an invitation (marked as "pending")
    - An invited user accepts and joins
    - An existing user is granted access through SSO
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Freeing Up Seats" icon="user-minus">
    To free a seat:
    - Remove an active member from the organization
    - Revoke a pending invitation
    - Wait for a pending invite to expire (if configured)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Upgrading Your License" icon="arrow-up">
    Need more seats?
    - **Teams Plan:** Contact your account manager or visit app.cline.bot/settings/billing to upgrade your license.
    - **Enterprise Plan:** Includes unlimited seats with no per-user restrictions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to maintain a secure organization:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Principle of Least Privilege" icon="shield-check">
    Always assign the minimum role necessary. Most users should be Members. Only grant Admin or Owner privileges when required for job duties.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Limit Owner Roles" icon="user-lock">
    Keep Owners to 1-2 key individuals who manage billing and security. This centralization prevents accidental or malicious changes to critical settings.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regular Audits" icon="clipboard-check">
    Review your member list quarterly. Remove inactive users promptly and verify that Admin/Owner roles are still appropriate for each user.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Offboarding Process" icon="door-open">
    Create a standard offboarding checklist: remove from Cline, revoke IDP access, document in audit log, and reassign any critical responsibilities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
**Owner Accountability:** Since Owners control billing and can transfer ownership, choose these individuals carefully and document the selection in your organization's security policies.
</Warning>

## Advanced Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transferring Ownership" icon="exchange">
    Only the current Owner can transfer ownership:
    
    1. Navigate to Organization Settings
    2. Go to the "Ownership" section
    3. Select the new Owner from the member list
    4. Confirm the transfer with your authentication
    5. The new Owner receives immediate control
    
    **Important:** This action cannot be undone by the previous Owner. The new Owner must initiate a reverse transfer if needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Managing Multiple Admins" icon="users-gear">
    When you have multiple Admins:
    
    - Document each Admin's area of responsibility
    - Use audit logs to track configuration changes
    - Consider creating rotation schedules for large teams
    - Establish escalation paths for Owner-level decisions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Temporary Access" icon="clock">
    For contractors or temporary staff:
    
    - Create them as Members with expiration calendar reminders
    - Document their access period in your internal systems
    - Set calendar reminders to remove them when the contract ends
    - Consider using time-limited IDP accounts if your IDP supports it
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Can't Accept Invitation" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Common causes:**
    - Email domain doesn't match verified domain
    - User's IDP access hasn't been granted yet
    - Invitation link expired
    
    **Solution:** Verify domain verification is complete and resend the invitation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't Remove an Admin" icon="user-slash">
    **Cause:** Only Owners can remove Admins.
    
    **Solution:** Ask an Owner to perform the removal, or if you need to remove your organization's sole Owner, contact support@cline.bot.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Out of Seats" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **When you've reached your license limit:**
    - Remove inactive members to free seats
    - Revoke pending invitations that are no longer needed
    - Upgrade your license to add more seats
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Now that you understand member management, proceed with configuring your organization:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card 
    title="Configure Providers" 
    icon="plug" 
    href="/enterprise-solutions/configuration/choosing-your-deployment"
  >
    Set up API providers for your team to use
  </Card>
  
  <Card 
    title="Monitor Usage" 
    icon="chart-line" 
    href="/enterprise-solutions/monitoring/overview"
  >
    Track team activity and resource consumption
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**Getting Started Fast?** The quickest path is: 1) Invite your team as Members, 2) Configure one API provider, 3) Let your team start using Cline. You can refine roles and settings later.
