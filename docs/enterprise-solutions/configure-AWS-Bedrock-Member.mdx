# Configure AWS Bedrock in VS Code (Members)

This guide explains how engineers configure AWS Bedrock credentials in the Cline VS Code extension after an administrator has enabled Bedrock at the organization level.

## Prerequisites

- Cline extension installed in VS Code
- Signed into your organization account in Cline
- AWS credentials with Bedrock access in the configured region
- Admin has already configured AWS Bedrock as the organization provider

---

## Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Open Cline Settings

1. **Open VS Code:** Ensure you have the Cline extension installed.

2. **Open Cline Settings:**
   - Click the settings icon (⚙️) in the Cline panel.
   - Alternatively, click on the API Provider dropdown located directly below the chat area (it will display as `bedrock.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0` or similar).

### Step 2: Select Your Authentication Method

Choose one of the following credential methods:

#### Option A: AWS Bedrock API Key

Use dedicated AWS access keys specifically for Bedrock access.\
[Learn more about AWS Bedrock API Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/api-keys.html)

1. Select the **API Key** radio button
2. Enter your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
3. These credentials are stored locally and used only by the VS Code extension

#### Option B: AWS Profile

Use an existing AWS CLI profile configured on your machine.\
[Learn more about AWS CLI Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html)

1. Select the **AWS Profile** radio button
2. Choose or enter the profile name from your `~/.aws/credentials` file
3. Cline will use the credentials associated with that profile

#### Option C: AWS Credentials

Use your default AWS credential chain (environment variables, EC2 instance roles, etc.).

1. Select the **AWS Credentials** radio button
2. Cline will automatically detect credentials from your environment using the standard AWS credential provider chain

**Note:** The AWS Region is preconfigured by your administrator and does not need to be set in the extension.

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

The extension will display checkmarks for enabled features:

- ✓ Supports images
- ✓ Supports browser use
- ✓ Supports prompt caching

Additional settings like cross-region inference and global inference profile will be locked (shown with a lock icon) as they're controlled by your administrator.

---

### Step 4: Test the Connection

Send a test message in Cline to verify your credentials work correctly with the configured Bedrock region. **it is recommended to do this in plan mode**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

**Error:** "Access Denied" or "Invalid Credentials"  
**Solution:** Verify your chosen credential method has the necessary IAM permissions to call Bedrock in the configured region. Required permissions include:

- `bedrock:InvokeModel`
- `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`

For more information, refer to [AWS Bedrock IAM Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/security-iam.html).

### Region Mismatch

**Error:** Region-related errors or "model not available"  
**Solution:** Ask your administrator to confirm which region is configured for your organization. Ensure your AWS credentials have access to Bedrock in that specific region.\
[AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)

### Provider Not Available

**Issue:** Don't see AWS Bedrock as an option  
**Solution:** 

1. Confirm you're signed into the correct Cline organization
2. Verify your administrator has saved the Bedrock configuration
3. Try signing out and back into the extension

### Credential Chain Issues

**Issue:** AWS Credentials option not finding credentials  
**Solution:**

- Verify AWS CLI is installed and configured (`aws configure`)\
  [AWS CLI Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- Check that credentials are present in `~/.aws/credentials`
- For EC2/ECS environments, ensure IAM roles are properly attached
- Set environment variables if using that method: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

---

## Additional Information

### Security Best Practices

- Use IAM roles with minimum required permissions\
  [AWS IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)
- Rotate access keys regularly if using the API Key method
- Avoid storing credentials in code or version control
- Use AWS Profile method when possible for better credential management
- Consider using AWS SSO/federated roles for enhanced security

### Model Selection

Your organization administrator controls which Claude models are available. The extension will display available models automatically based on your region's Bedrock configuration. For information about available models, refer to the [AWS Bedrock Model Access documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).

---

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully configure AWS Bedrock credentials in the Cline VS Code extension:

1. **Open Cline Settings:** Access the settings panel via the settings icon or API Provider dropdown
2. **Select Authentication Method:** Choose API Key, AWS Profile, or AWS Credentials based on your environment
3. **Verify Configuration:** Confirm that enabled features are displayed correctly
4. **Test Connection:** Send a test message to verify everything works

For further details, consult the [AWS Bedrock Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html) and coordinate with your organization's cloud administrator.
