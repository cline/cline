## Configuration Steps


### Step 1: Access Cline Settings

Navigate to [app.cline.bot](https://app.cline.bot) and sign in with your administrator account. 
Go to **Settings â†’ Cline Settings**.


### Step 2: Enable Remote Provider Configuration


Toggle on **Enable settings** to reveal the remote provider configuration options. This allows you to enforce provider settings across your organization.


### Step 3: Select AWS Bedrock as the API Provider

Open the **API Provider** dropdown menu and select **Amazon Bedrock**. This will open the Bedrock configuration panel.

### Step 4: Configure Bedrock Settings

In the provider configuration panel, configure the following settings:

**Region** (required)  
Enter your preferred AWS region (e.g., `us-west-2`, `us-east-1`). This region will be enforced for all organization members.\
[AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)

**Custom VPC Endpoint** (optional)  
If your organization uses a private VPC endpoint for Bedrock, specify it here to ensure traffic routes through your network infrastructure.\
[Learn more about AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/endpoint-services-overview.html)

**Cross-region Inference** (optional)  
Enable this option to allow Bedrock to route requests to other regions when your primary region has capacity constraints. Useful for maintaining availability during high-demand periods.\
[Learn more about Inference Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-profiles-support.html)

**Global Inference Profile** (optional)  
Enable this to use AWS's global inference routing, which automatically directs requests to the optimal region based on availability and latency.

**Prompt Caching** (optional)  
Enable prompt caching to reduce costs and latency for repeated prompts. Bedrock will cache portions of prompts that remain consistent across requests.\

### Step 5: Save Configuration

After configuring all settings, close the provider configuration panel and click **Save** on the settings page to persist your changes.

Once saved, all organization members signed into the Cline extension will automatically use AWS Bedrock with your configured settings. They will not be able to select other providers. 


**Note:** Members of your organization will not be able to switch to their personal Cline account, or another organization once remote configuration is enabled.

---

## Verification

To verify the configuration:

1. Check that the provider shows as "Amazon Bedrock" in the Enabled provider field
2. Confirm the settings persist after refreshing the page
3. Test with a member account to ensure they see only Bedrock as an option

---

## Troubleshooting

**Members don't see the configured provider**  
Ensure you clicked Save after closing the configuration panel. Verify the member account belongs to the correct organization.

**Configuration changes don't persist**  
Make sure to click the Save button on the main settings page, not just close the configuration panel.

**Need to change regions later**  
You can update the region at any time. Members will need to ensure their local AWS credentials have access to the new region. For more information, refer to the [AWS Bedrock Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html).

---

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can successfully configure AWS Bedrock as your organization's centralized LLM provider:

1. **Access Cline Settings:** Navigate to the admin console and enable remote provider configuration
2. **Select AWS Bedrock:** Choose Amazon Bedrock from the API Provider dropdown
3. **Configure Settings:** Set your region, VPC endpoint, and other Bedrock features
4. **Save and Verify:** Persist your changes and verify that members can access the configured provider

For further details, consult the [AWS Bedrock Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html) and coordinate with your internal cloud team.
