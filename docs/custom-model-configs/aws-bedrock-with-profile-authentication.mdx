### Configuration Steps

1. Install the [latest version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) of AWS CLI

    - Follow the AWS docs to install your OS-specific version of AWS CLI

2. [Configure IAM authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) with the AWS CLI

    - If you do not already have AWS access through the IAM Identity Center, follow the [IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to set up IAM users and roles. Ensure you have a `PowerUserAccess` role.
    - If you have access to AWS through your employer, open your AWS access portal and find the appropriate account. Ensure you have `PowerUserAccess` permissions.
    - Open the `Access keys` link and note the `SSO start URL` and `SSO region`, which are needed in the next step

3. Continue configuring your profile using [the `aws configure sso` CLI wizard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html#cli-configure-sso-configure)

    - Once configured, use the following command to authenticate the AWS CLI: `aws sso login --profile <AWS-profile-name>`
    - Note which profile name you attach to your AWS account, this is needed to configure Cline in the following steps

4. If you haven't already done so, install VSCode and the Cline extension. Consult the [Getting Started](/getting-started) page for guidance.

5. Open the Cline extension, then click on the settings button ⚙️ to select your API Provider.
    - From the API Provider dropdown, select AWS Bedrock
    - Select the AWS Profile radio button, then enter the AWS Profile Name from step 3
    - Select your AWS Region from the dropdown menu
    - Selecting the cross-region inference checkbox is required for some models
