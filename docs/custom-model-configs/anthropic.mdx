### Tips and Notes

*   **Prompt Caching:** Claude 3 models support [prompt caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching), which can significantly reduce costs and latency for repeated prompts.
*   **Context Window:** Claude models have large context windows (200,000 tokens), allowing you to include a significant amount of code and context in your prompts.
*   **Pricing:** Refer to the [Anthropic Pricing](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing) page for the latest pricing information.
*   **Rate Limits:** Anthropic has strict rate limits based on [usage tiers](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits#requirements-to-advance-tier). If you're repeatedly hitting rate limits, consider contacting Anthropic sales or accessing Claude through a different provider like [OpenRouter](/custom-model-configs/openrouter) or [Requesty](/custom-model-configs/requesty).
