### Overview

**GCP Vertex AI:**\
A fully managed service that provides access to leading generative AI models—such as Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2—through Google Cloud.\
[Learn more about GCP Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).

This guide is tailored for organizations with established GCP environments (leveraging IAM roles, service accounts, and best practices in resource management) to ensure secure and compliant usage.

---

### Step 1: Prepare Your GCP Environment

#### 1.1 Create or Use a GCP Project

-   **Sign in to the GCP Console:**\
    [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
-   **Select or Create a Project:**\
    Use an existing project or create a new one dedicated to Vertex AI.

#### 1.2 Set Up IAM Permissions and Service Accounts

-   **Assign Required Roles:**

    -   Grant your user (or service account) the **Vertex AI User** role (`roles/aiplatform.user`)
    -   For service accounts, also attach the **Vertex AI Service Agent** role (`roles/aiplatform.serviceAgent`) to enable certain operations
    -   Consider additional predefined roles as needed:
        -   Vertex AI Platform Express Admin
        -   Vertex AI Platform Express User
        -   Vertex AI Migration Service User

-   **Cross-Project Resource Access:**
    -   For BigQuery tables in different projects, assign the **BigQuery Data Viewer** role
    -   For Cloud Storage buckets in different projects, assign the **Storage Object Viewer** role
    -   For external data sources, refer to the [GCP Vertex AI Access Control documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control)

---

### Step 2: Verify Regional and Model Access

#### 2.1 Choose and Confirm a Region

Vertex AI supports eight regions. Select a region that meets your latency, compliance, and capacity needs. Examples include:

-   **us-east5 (Columbus, Ohio)**
-   **us-east1 (South Carolina)**
-   **us-east4 (Northern Virginia)**
-   **us-central1 (Iowa)**
-   **us-west1 (The Dalles, Oregon)**
-   **us-west4 (Las Vegas, Nevada)**
-   **europe-west1 (Belgium)**
-   **asia-southeast1 (Singapore)**

#### 2.2 Enable the Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 Model

-   **Open Vertex AI Model Garden:**\
    In the Cloud Console, navigate to **Vertex AI → Model Garden**
-   **Enable Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2:**\
    Locate the model card for Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 and click **Enable**

---

### Step 3: Configure the Cline VS Code Extension

#### 3.1 Install and Open Cline

-   **Download VS Code:**\
    [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   **Install the Cline Extension:**
    -   Open VS Code
    -   Navigate to the Extensions Marketplace (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
    -   Search for **Cline** and install the extension

#### 3.2 Configure Cline Settings

-   **Open Cline Settings:**\
    Click the settings ⚙️ icon within the Cline extension
-   **Set API Provider:**\
    Choose **GCP Vertex AI** from the API Provider dropdown
-   **Enter Your Google Cloud Project ID:**\
    Provide the project ID you set up earlier
-   **Select the Region:**\
    Choose one of the supported regions (e.g., `us-east5`)
-   **Select the Model:**\
    From the available list, choose **Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2**
-   **Save and Test:**\
    Save your settings and test by sending a simple prompt (e.g., "Generate a Python function to check if a number is prime.")

---

### Step 4: Authentication and Credentials Setup

#### Option A: Using Your Google Account (User Credentials)

1. **Install the Google Cloud CLI:**\
   Follow the [installation guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
2. **Initialize and Authenticate:**

    ```bash
    gcloud init
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

    - This sets up Application Default Credentials (ADC) using your Google account

3. **Restart VS Code:**\
   Ensure VS Code is restarted so that the Cline extension picks up the new credentials

#### Option B: Using a Service Account (JSON Key)

1. **Create a Service Account:**

    - In the GCP Console, navigate to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**
    - Create a new service account (e.g., "vertex-ai-client")

2. **Assign Roles:**

    - Attach **Vertex AI User** (`roles/aiplatform.user`)
    - Attach **Vertex AI Service Agent** (`roles/aiplatform.serviceAgent`)
    - Optionally, add other roles as required

3. **Generate a JSON Key:**

    - In the Service Accounts section, manage keys for your service account and download the JSON key

4. **Set the Environment Variable:**

    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
    ```

    - This instructs Google Cloud client libraries (and Cline) to use this key

5. **Restart VS Code:**\
   Launch VS Code from a terminal where the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable is set

---

### Step 5: Security, Monitoring, and Best Practices

#### 5.1 Enforce Least Privilege

-   **Principle of Least Privilege:**\
    Only grant the minimum necessary permissions. Custom roles can offer finer control compared to broad predefined roles
-   **Best Practices:**\
    Refer to [GCP IAM Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices)

#### 5.2 Manage Resource Access

-   **Project vs. Resource-Level Access:**\
    Access can be managed at both levels. Note that resource-level permissions (e.g., for BigQuery or Cloud Storage) add to, but do not override, project-level policies

#### 5.3 Monitor Usage and Quotas

-   **Model Observability Dashboard:**

    -   In the Vertex AI Console, navigate to the **Model Observability** dashboard
    -   Monitor metrics such as request throughput, latency, and error rates (including 429 quota errors)

-   **Quota Management:**
    -   If you encounter 429 errors, check the **IAM & Admin > Quotas** page
    -   Request a quota increase if necessary\
        [Learn more about GCP Vertex AI Quotas](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/quotas)

#### 5.4 Service Agents and Cross-Project Considerations

-   **Service Agents:**\
    Be aware of the different service agents:

    -   Vertex AI Service Agent
    -   Vertex AI RAG Data Service Agent
    -   Vertex AI Custom Code Service Agent
    -   Vertex AI Extension Service Agent

-   **Cross-Project Access:**\
    For resources in other projects (e.g., BigQuery, Cloud Storage), ensure that the appropriate roles (BigQuery Data Viewer, Storage Object Viewer) are assigned

---

### Conclusion
