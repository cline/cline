# Agent & Python Integration

The AI-Hydro map is not a passive viewer — the agent can read the full map state, push new layers, re-style existing ones, control the viewport, and execute analysis that feeds results directly back to the canvas.

## How Layers Flow from Python to the Map

When a Python tool calls any map-aware MCP function, the events travel through this pipeline:

1. The MCP tool calls `ai_hydro.mcp.map_events.push_layer(layer)` on the server side
2. The server writes a small JSON event file to `~/.aihydro/map_events/`
3. The VS Code extension file-watcher picks it up (~600 ms polling interval), calls `controller.addMapLayer()`, and deletes the file
4. The controller forwards the layer over the **gRPC `MapService.subscribeToMapLayers` stream**
5. `MapContext` in the webview receives the stream event and updates React state — deck.gl re-renders

For GEE tile layers, the Python tool computes the tile URL template using `geemap` and passes it in `metadata.gee_tile_url_template`. The map fetches tiles directly from the GEE Maps API (requires an authenticated GEE session on the Python side).

## Analysis Tools That Push Layers Automatically

| Tool | Layer pushed | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `delineate_watershed` | Watershed boundary polygon + outlet point | Vector |
| `compute_twi` | TWI grid (viridis_r, 70% opacity) | Raster |
| `create_cn_grid` | Curve Number grid (YlOrRd, 70% opacity) | Raster |
| `show_on_map` | Any GeoJSON you pass | Vector |
| `gee.preview_layer` | Google Earth Engine tile mosaic | GEE tile |
| `merit_add_map_layers` | MERIT river network for a basin | Vector |
| `wbd_add_map_layers` | WBD HUC boundaries | Vector |

---

## `show_on_map`

Push any geometry from a Python analysis session directly to the map:

```python
show_on_map(
    geojson=my_geojson_string,   # FeatureCollection / Feature / Geometry
    name="Study Area",
    layer_type="polygon",        # polygon | line | point
    style_preset="watershed",    # watershed | flowlines | gauge | default
    auto_zoom=True,
)
```

### Style presets

| Preset | Fill colour | Stroke | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `watershed` | `#1a6eb5` (20% opacity) | `#003399` 2 px | Catchment polygons |
| `flowlines` | transparent | `#3399ff` 1.5 px | River / stream lines |
| `gauge` | `#e05c00` | `#993300` 1 px | Station point markers |
| `default` | `#0066CC` | `#003399` 1 px | General purpose |

## Agent Map Orchestration Tools

The agent can read and update the live map state using these MCP tools — without the user needing to do anything manually.

### Reading map state

```
map_get_state      → basemap, view centre/zoom, active ROI, full layer catalog
map_list_layers    → layer catalog only (IDs, names, types, styles, numeric attributes)
```

### Updating existing layers

```
map_update_layer(layer_id, fill_color, stroke_color, opacity, display_name, visible)
map_apply_symbology(layer_id, graduated_attribute, method, classes, color_ramp)
map_remove_layer(layer_id)
```

### Viewport control

```
map_fit_extent            → fit all visible layers
map_fit_layer(layer_id)   → fit a specific layer
map_set_basemap(id)       → change the active basemap
```

> **Do not** write a second GeoJSON file just to re-style a layer that is already on the map. Use `map_update_layer` for style changes; use `show_on_map` only when adding **new** geometry.

## Agent Workflows Triggered from the Map

Several map panels send context directly to the agent chat, pre-loading all the spatial information the agent needs:

| Source | What is sent |
|---|---|
| **Feature Inspector → Ask AI** | Click coordinates, all visible layer names and types, vector feature properties at that point, raster pixel value |
| **Feature Inspector → Delineate (agent)** | Click coordinates with a pre-filled delineation instruction |
| **Annotations → Ask Agent** | Annotation geometry, My Notes, AI Prompt, visible layer list |
| **Annotations → Batch Ask Agent** | Full collection as a coordinate/geometry/notes table |
| **Transects → Ask Agent** | Waypoints, full 200-point profile, geomorphic metrics, sampled layer name/units |
| **Transects → Batch Ask Agent** | Collection as a CSV table with per-transect profile statistics |

---

## Workspace Persistence

Map state survives panel close, VS Code restart, and extension updates. The following are saved to `localStorage` under `aihydro.map.workspace.v1`:

- Selected basemap
- View state (longitude, latitude, zoom, pitch, bearing)
- Visible layer IDs
- Per-layer opacity overrides
- Layer display name aliases
- Clustering-enabled layer IDs
- Ribbon panel dimensions

Annotations are saved separately under `aihydro.map.annotations.v1`. Transects are saved under `aihydro.map.transects.v1`.

## Tips

- Use `map_list_layers` in an agent prompt to let the agent discover the current layer catalog before deciding what analysis to run — avoids "layer not found" errors from stale IDs
- The `style_preset` in `show_on_map` is the fastest way to enforce consistent styling across all delineation outputs — all watershed polygons in the same session get the same blue fill
- After a batch transect analysis, the agent can call `map_apply_symbology` on any vector layer in the response to immediately visualize the results (e.g. colour-code HUC polygons by peak discharge)
- The file-watcher polling interval is ~600 ms — for rapid sequential tool calls the map may update in bursts rather than one layer at a time
