Use these templates as starting points for new documentation. Each template is designed for a specific purpose. Choose the one that best fits what you're documenting.

## Choosing a Template

| If you're documenting... | Use this template |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| What a feature does and how to use it | Feature Doc |
| How to accomplish a specific task | How-To Guide |
| Technical specifications or API details | Reference Doc |
| A complete project walkthrough | Tutorial |

## Feature Doc

Use this template when explaining a Cline feature. Focus on what it does, how to use it, and real examples.

````text
---
title: "Feature Name"
sidebarTitle: "Feature Name"
---

[One sentence explaining what this feature does.]

<Frame>
  <img src="..." alt="Feature in action" />
</Frame>

[1-2 paragraphs explaining the feature in plain terms. What problem does it 
solve? Why would someone use it?]

## How It Works

[Explain the mechanics without jargon. What happens when you use this feature?]

## Using [Feature Name]

[Show how to access and use it. Include the exact UI path.]

### [Option or Variation 1]

[Details with examples]

### [Option or Variation 2]

[Details with examples]

## Inspiration

examples that spark imagination about what's possible.]

<Note>
  [Important caveat, limitation, or requirement]
</Note>

### Example: Checkpoints Feature

Here's how the [Checkpoints](/core-workflows/checkpoints) doc follows this pattern:

- Opens with one clear sentence about what checkpoints do
- Shows a screenshot of the feature in action
- Explains how checkpoints work under the hood
- Shows exact steps to create and restore checkpoints
- Includes real examples of when checkpoints save the day

## How-To Guide

Use this template when showing how to accomplish a specific task. Focus on clear steps and troubleshooting.

### Example Structure

A good tutorial:
- Shows the end result upfront so readers know what they're building
- Breaks the work into logical parts
- Explains the "why" alongside the "how"
- Ends with clear next steps

## Quick Tips

When using these templates:

1. **Delete sections you don't need.** Templates are starting points, not rigid structures.

2. **Add sections that make sense.** If your doc needs something not in the template, add it.

3. **Keep the reader moving forward.** Every section should lead naturally to the next.

4. **Test your own instructions.** Follow your guide from scratch to catch missing steps.

<Tip>
  Use the `/write-docs` workflow to generate documentation from these templates automatically. 
  Cline helps you fill in each section based on your project.
