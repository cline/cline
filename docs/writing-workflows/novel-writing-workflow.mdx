# Novel Writing Workflow with Ponder

This guide provides a step-by-step workflow for writing a novel using Ponder's AI assistance. Whether you're a first-time novelist or an experienced author, this structured approach will help you leverage Ponder's capabilities throughout your entire writing process.

## Phase 1: Concept Development (Week 1-2)

### Step 1: Initial Concept Exploration

**Prompt Example:**
```
I have a rough idea for a science fiction novel about a colony ship that loses contact with Earth. Help me develop this concept by exploring:
- What makes this story unique in the sci-fi genre?
- What are the potential themes and deeper meanings?
- Who might be the main characters and what are their conflicts?
- What are the stakes and what could go wrong?
- How can I make this personally meaningful to write?
```

### Step 2: Genre and Market Research

```
Research the current science fiction market for colony ship/generation ship stories:
- What similar books have been published recently?
- What approaches have been overdone?
- What fresh angles could I bring to this concept?
- Who is the target audience for this type of story?
- What are the current trends in science fiction publishing?
```

### Step 3: Core Premise Refinement

```
Help me refine my premise into a compelling one-sentence logline and a paragraph summary that captures:
- The protagonist and their goal
- The central conflict or obstacle
- The stakes (what happens if they fail)
- What makes this story unique
- The emotional core of the story
```

## Phase 2: Character Development (Week 2-3)

### Step 4: Protagonist Creation

```
Create a detailed character profile for my protagonist - the ship's communications officer who discovers the lost contact:
- Background: age, family, education, how they got this job
- Personality: strengths, flaws, fears, desires
- Skills and expertise relevant to the plot
- Personal stakes in reconnecting with Earth
- Character arc: how will they change throughout the story?
- Voice and dialogue patterns
```

### Step 5: Supporting Characters

```
Develop 4-5 key supporting characters for my colony ship story:
- The ship's captain (authority figure, potential ally/antagonist)
- A fellow crew member (potential romantic interest or best friend)
- A colonist leader (represents civilian concerns)
- An engineer (technical expertise, different perspective)
- A child or elderly person (represents hope/wisdom)

For each character, provide: role in story, relationship to protagonist, personal goals, potential conflicts
```

### Step 6: Character Relationships and Dynamics

```
Map out the relationships between my main characters:
- How do they know each other?
- What are their alliances and conflicts?
- How do their goals align or clash?
- What secrets might they keep from each other?
- How will these relationships evolve throughout the story?
```

## Phase 3: World Building and Plot Structure (Week 3-4)

### Step 7: Setting Development

```
Help me develop the world of my generation ship story:
- Ship design and layout (where do scenes take place?)
- Daily life and social structure of the colonists
- Technology level and limitations
- Resources and constraints
- History of the mission and previous events
- Cultural elements that have developed during the journey
```

### Step 8: Plot Outline Creation

```
Create a detailed three-act structure for my novel:

Act 1 (25%): Setup and Inciting Incident
- Introduce protagonist and normal life on ship
- Establish the communication loss problem
- Show initial attempts to solve it
- End with discovery that makes everything worse

Act 2A (25%): Rising Action
- Protagonist investigates the problem deeper
- Introduce complications and obstacles
- Develop relationships and subplots
- Raise stakes and tension

Act 2B (25%): Midpoint and Complications
- Major revelation or plot twist
- Everything seems lost
- Character relationships tested
- New obstacles emerge

Act 3 (25%): Climax and Resolution
- Final confrontation or challenge
- Character growth and change
- Resolution of main plot and subplots
- Satisfying conclusion

Include specific scene ideas and chapter breaks.
```

### Step 9: Chapter-by-Chapter Breakdown

```
Break down my three-act structure into 20-25 chapters:
- What happens in each chapter?
- Whose POV (if multiple perspectives)?
- What is the chapter's purpose in advancing plot/character?
- What is the emotional arc of each chapter?
- How does each chapter end to maintain momentum?
- Approximate word count per chapter (aim for 3,000-4,000 words)
```

## Phase 4: First Draft Writing (Week 5-16)

### Step 10: Chapter Writing Process

For each chapter, follow this process:

**Pre-Writing:**
```
Before writing Chapter [X], help me:
- Review what happened in previous chapters
- Clarify this chapter's goals and outcomes

```

**Writing Session:**
```
I'm writing the scene where [describe scene]. Help me:

```

**Post-Writing Review:**
```
Review this chapter I just wrote:

```

### Step 11: Maintaining Consistency

- Find a way to surprise myself and the reader
```

## Phase 5: Revision and Editing (Week 17-24)

- Do all subplots resolve satisfactorily?
- Is the character arc complete and satisfying?
- Are there plot holes or logical inconsistencies?
- What scenes need to be added, cut, or moved?
```

### Step 14: Character Arc Review

```
Analyze each main character's arc throughout the novel:
- Do they change and grow in believable ways?
- Are their motivations clear and consistent?
- Do their actions drive the plot forward?
- Are their relationships developed fully?
- Does each character serve a purpose in the story?
```

### Step 15: Scene-Level Editing

For each chapter:

```
Edit Chapter [X] for:
