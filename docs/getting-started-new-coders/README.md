# Getting Started with Cline | New Coders

Welcome to Cline! This guide will help you get set up and start using Cline to build your first project.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

-   **VS Code:** A free, powerful code editor.
    -   [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   **Development Tools:** Essential software for coding (Homebrew, Node.js, Git, etc.).
    -   Follow our [Installing Essential Development Tools](installing-dev-essentials.md) guide to set these up with Cline's help (after getting setup here)
    -   Cline will guide you through installing everything you need
-   **Cline Projects Folder:** A dedicated folder for all your Cline projects.
    -   On macOS: Create a folder named "Cline" in your Documents folder
        -   Path: `/Users/[your-username]/Documents/Cline`
    -   On Windows: Create a folder named "Cline" in your Documents folder
        -   Path: `C:\Users\[your-username]\Documents\Cline`
    -   Inside this Cline folder, create separate folders for each project
        -   Example: `Documents/Cline/workout-app` for a workout tracking app
        -   Example: `Documents/Cline/portfolio-website` for your portfolio
-   **Cline Extension in VS Code:** The Cline extension installed in VS Code.

    - Click the Cline icon in the Activity Bar.
    - Use the command palette (`CMD/CTRL + Shift + P`) and type "Cline: Open In New Tab" to open Cline as a tab in your editor. This is recommended for a better view.

    -   Input your OpenRouter API key.
    -   Select your preferred API model.
        -   **Recommended Models for Coding:**
            -   `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`: Most used for coding tasks.
            -   `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free`: A free option for coding.
            -   `deepseek/deepseek-chat`: SUPER CHEAP, almost as good as 3.5 sonnet

## Your First Interaction with Cline

Now you're ready to start building with Cline. Let's create your first project folder and build something! Copy and paste the following prompt into the Cline chat window:

```
Hey Cline! Could you help me create a new project folder called "hello-world" in my Cline directory and make a simple webpage that says "Hello World" in big blue text?
```

**What You'll See:** Cline will help you create the project folder and set up your first webpage.

## FAQs

-   **What is the Terminal?** The terminal is a text-based interface for interacting with your computer. It allows you to run commands to perform various tasks, such as installing packages, running scripts, and managing files. Cline uses the terminal to execute commands and interact with your development environment.
