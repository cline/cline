     - Attributes: productivity, comparison_years
     - Methods: analyze_trends()

Each module is interconnected, forming a comprehensive system for managing various aspects of coffee production, from soil and pest analysis to financial transactions and quality control.

### Database Schema

The database schema for the Coffee Management System is structured as follows:

* **Dashboard**
  - `dashboard`: id (PK), global_metrics, alerts, user_notifications

* **Gestão de Talhões (Plot Management)**
  - `coffee_plot`: id (PK), variety, location, area, soil_status, pest_status, planting_density
  - `soil_analysis`: id (PK), coffee_plot_id (FK), ph_level, organic_matter, nutrients, analysis_date
  - `leaf_analysis`: id (PK), coffee_plot_id (FK), nitrogen, potassium, calcium
  - `pest_analysis`: id (PK), coffee_plot_id (FK), pest_type, severity, treatment_date

* **Gestão Financeira (Financial Management)**
  - `finance`: id (PK), transactions, cash_flow, financial_goals
  - `future_sale`: id (PK), finance_id (FK), contract_id, quantity, contract_value, delivery_date

* **Controle de Estoque (Inventory Control)**
  - `inventory`: id (PK), stock_items, total_stock_value
  - `product`: id (PK), inventory_id (FK), product_id, name, category, supplier, expiry_date

* **Controle de Qualidade (Quality Control)**
  - `quality_control`: id (PK), lot_id, cupping_score, defect_points
  - `cupping_score`: id (PK), quality_control_id (FK), aroma, body, aftertaste, balance, sweetness
  - `defect_analysis`: id (PK), quality_control_id (FK), defect_type, quantity, severity

* **Rastreabilidade (Traceability)**
  - `traceability`: id (PK), batch_id, origin, transport_details

* **Gestão de Maquinário (Machinery Management)**
  - `machinery`: id (PK), equipment_id, model, purchase_date, maintenance_schedule

* **Relatórios (Reports)**
  - `report`: id (PK), report_type, data_source
  - `production_report`: id (PK), report_id (FK), productivity, comparison_years

This schema ensures that each module is represented by its respective tables, with primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) to maintain relationships between the tables. This structure will help in managing the coffee production and distribution efficiently.

### Interactions

The modules in the Coffee Management System interact with each other through various classes and methods. Here is an overview of how the modules interact:

* **Dashboard**: The `Dashboard` class fetches data and renders views, which may include metrics and notifications from other modules.
* **Gestão de Talhões (Plot Management)**: The `CoffeePlot` class interacts with `SoilAnalysis`, `LeafAnalysis`, and `PestAnalysis` classes to analyze soil, detect deficiencies, and assess pest risks.
* **Gestão Financeira (Financial Management)**: The `Finance` class manages transactions and cash flow, while the `FutureSale` class calculates risks and adjusts prices based on financial data.
* **Controle de Estoque (Inventory Control)**: The `Inventory` class manages stock items and interacts with the `Product` class to calculate values and check availability.
* **Controle de Qualidade (Quality Control)**: The `QualityControl` class assesses quality and finalizes reports, interacting with `CuppingScore` and `DefectAnalysis` classes to calculate scores and classify defects.
* **Rastreabilidade (Traceability)**: The `Traceability` class traces lots and generates audits, ensuring the origin and transport details are tracked.
* **Gestão de Maquinário (Machinery Management)**: The `Machinery` class schedules maintenance and updates the status of equipment.
* **Relatórios (Reports)**: The `Report` class generates and exports reports, while the `ProductionReport` class analyzes productivity trends.

These interactions form a comprehensive system for managing various aspects of coffee production, from soil and pest analysis to financial transactions and quality control.
