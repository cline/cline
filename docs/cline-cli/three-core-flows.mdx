description: "Learn the three ways to use Cline CLI: interactive mode, direct task execution, and automation"
---

Cline CLI supports three primary workflows, each optimized for different use cases. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.

<Note>
**Migrating from an older CLI version?** Instance commands (`cline instance new/list/kill`) have been removed in Cline CLI 2.0. The new architecture is simpler. Just run `cline` for interactive mode or `cline "task"` for direct execution.
</Note>

## 1. Interactive Mode

The interactive CLI provides the richest experience for interactive development.

### Getting Started

```bash
cline
```

This launches an interactive session in your current directory. Type your task, and Cline will analyze and execute it.

### Key Features

**Plan/Act Mode Toggle** - Press `Tab` to switch between modes:
- **Plan Mode**: Cline analyzes your request and presents a strategy
- **Act Mode**: Cline executes actions directly

**Auto-approve Toggle** - Press `Shift+Tab` to enable automatic approval for all actions.

**Slash Commands** - Type `/` for quick access to:
- `/settings` - Configure providers, models, and features
- `/models` - Quick model switching
- `/history` - Browse and resume previous tasks
- `/clear` - Start a fresh task
- `/help` - Show available commands

**File Mentions** - Type `@` to reference workspace files:
```
@src/utils.ts add error handling to this file
```

**Session Summary** - When you exit with `Ctrl+C`, Cline displays a summary of your session including tasks completed, files modified, and token usage.

### When to Use Interactive Mode

- Exploring a new codebase
- Complex refactoring that requires back-and-forth
- Learning how Cline approaches problems
- Tasks where you want to review before executing

## 2. Direct Task Execution

Execute tasks directly from the command line without entering interactive mode.

### Basic Usage

```bash
cline "Add unit tests to utils.js"
```

Cline analyzes your task, creates a plan, and executes it. You'll be prompted for approval at key decision points.

### Piping Context

Pipe file contents or command output into Cline:

```bash
# Explain a file
cat README.md | cline "Summarize this document"

# Review git changes
git diff | cline "Review these changes and suggest improvements"

# Analyze command output
npm test 2>&1 | cline "Analyze these test failures and fix them"
```

### Chaining Cline Commands

Pipe Cline's output into another Cline instance for creative workflows:

```bash
# Explain changes, then write a commit message
git diff | cline -y "explain these changes" | cline -y "write a commit message for this"

# Generate code, then write tests
cline -y "create a fibonacci function" | cline -y "write unit tests for this code"

# Fun: Generate a poem about your code
git diff | cline -y "explain" | cline -y "write a haiku about this"
```

### Including Images

Attach images to your task:

```bash
cline task -i screenshot.png "Fix the layout issue shown in this screenshot"

# Or reference inline
cline "Fix the UI shown in @./design-mockup.png"
```

### Mode Selection

```bash
# Start in Plan mode (analyze before acting)
cline -p "Design a REST API for user management"

# Start in Act mode (default)
cline -a "Fix the typo in README.md"
```

### When to Use Direct Execution

- Quick, well-defined tasks
- Tasks with sufficient context in the prompt
- Scripting and shell workflows
- When you don't need interactive conversation

## 3. Automation & CI/CD

For fully autonomous operation in scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and automated workflows.

### YOLO Mode (Yes Mode)

The `-y` or `--yolo` flag enables fully autonomous operation:

```bash
cline -y "Run the test suite and fix any failures"
```

In YOLO mode:
- All actions are auto-approved
- Output is plain text (non-interactive)
- Process exits automatically when complete
- Perfect for CI/CD and scripts

<Warning>
Run YOLO mode on a clean git branch or directory. You get speed in exchange for oversight, so be ready to revert if needed.
</Warning>

### JSON Output

Use `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
cline --json "List all TODO comments in the codebase" | jq '.text'
```

JSON output follows the same format as task files in `~/.cline/data/tasks/<id>/ui_messages.json`.

**JSON Message Schema:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | `"ask"` or `"say"` | Message category |
| `text` | `string` | Message content |
| `ts` | `number` | Unix timestamp (ms) |
| `reasoning` | `string` | (Optional) Model reasoning |
| `partial` | `boolean` | (Optional) Streaming flag |

### Timeout Control

Set a maximum execution time:

```bash
cline -y --timeout 600 "Run full test suite"
```

### Environment Variables

Control Cline behavior via environment variables:

**CLINE_DIR** - Custom configuration directory:
```bash
export CLINE_DIR=/path/to/config
cline -y "your task"
```

**CLINE_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS** - Restrict allowed commands:
```bash
export CLINE_COMMAND_PERMISSIONS='{"allow": ["npm *", "git *"], "deny": ["rm -rf *"]}'
cline -y "your task"
```

See [Configuration](/cline-cli/configuration#environment-variables) for full documentation.

### GitHub Actions Example

Automate PR reviews with Cline:

```yaml
name: AI Code Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'
      
      - name: Install Cline
        run: npm install -g cline
      
      - name: Configure Cline
        run: cline auth -p anthropic -k ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      
      - name: Review PR
        run: |
          git diff origin/main...HEAD | cline -y "Review this PR for:
          - Potential bugs
          - Security issues  
          - Performance concerns
          - Code style violations
          
          Provide a summary of findings."
```

### Shell Script Example

Create a code review script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# review.sh - AI-powered code review

set -e

# Get the diff
DIFF=$(git diff HEAD~1)

if [ -z "$DIFF" ]; then
  echo "No changes to review"
  exit 0
fi

# Run Cline review
echo "$DIFF" | cline -y --json "Review this code diff for issues" | jq -r '.text'
```

### When to Use Automation Mode

- CI/CD pipelines
- Scheduled maintenance tasks
- Batch processing
- Any workflow requiring non-interactive execution

## Choosing the Right Flow

| Use Case | Recommended Flow |
|----------|------------------|
| Exploring a new codebase | Interactive Mode |
| Complex refactoring | Interactive Mode (Plan first) |
| Quick file edits | Direct Execution |
| Code review | Direct Execution with pipe |
| CI/CD integration | Automation (`-y` flag) |
| Scheduled tasks | Automation (`-y` flag) |
| Learning Cline | Interactive Mode |
