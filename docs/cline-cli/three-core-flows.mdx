description: "Learn the four ways to run Cline CLI: interactive, task, YOLO, and plain text modes"
---

Use these four modes to decide how much interactivity you want when running the Cline CLI.

- **Interactive Mode**: Best for exploring new problems, learning how Cline works, or collaborating with the UI in real time.
- **Task Mode**: Ideal when you want to start immediately with a prompt, while still getting the UI if you're in a TTY.
- **YOLO Mode (-y)**: Use for one-shot autonomous runs that skip approvals (great for CI/CD).
- **Plain Text Mode**: Perfect for automation, CI/CD, or any time you want clean output without the UI.


## 1. Interactive Mode: Rich terminal UI

Start Cline without arguments to launch the interactive welcome prompt and terminal UI.

```bash
cline
```

You can type your task, review the conversation history, and interact with Cline in real time. This is the best way to explore new tasks, refine prompts, and stay in the loop during execution.

Type `/` to see all the commands available throughout the terminal user experiences.

## 2. Task Mode: Start immediately with a prompt

Run a prompt inline to kick off a task right away.

```bash
cline "Draft release notes for version 1.4"

# Equivalent
cline task "Draft release notes for version 1.4"
```

If you're running in an interactive terminal (stdin is a TTY), you still get the interactive UI. If stdin is piped or output is redirected, the CLI automatically switches to plain text output.

## 3. YOLO Mode (-y): One-shot autonomous runs

Use `-y` (yes/YOLO) to approve all steps automatically and get a one-shot response. This is the go-to mode for autonomous workflows like CI/CD.

```bash
cline -y "Summarize flaky tests in this repo"

# With --cwd for a specific worktree or repo
cline -y --cwd ~/repo "Generate release notes"
```

YOLO mode skips interactive approvals and runs the task end-to-end without pausing for confirmation.

## 4. Plain Text Mode: Clean output for scripts

Plain text mode activates automatically when stdin is piped, output is redirected, or you use `--json` or `--yolo`.

```bash
# Pipe in input with YOLO for one-shot output
echo "Summarize these logs" | cline -y

# Redirect output with YOLO enabled
cline -y "Generate changelog" > changelog.txt

# Force structured output (also plain text mode)
cline -y "List TODOs" --json
```

In this mode, Cline outputs clean text ideal for CI/CD pipelines, scripts, and automation.
