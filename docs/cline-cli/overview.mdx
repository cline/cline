## What is Cline CLI?

Cline CLI brings AI-powered coding agents to your terminal. Run multiple Cline
instances simultaneously, automate code reviews in CI/CD pipelines, pipe git
diffs directly to Cline for analysis, or script complex workflows that integrate
with your existing tools.

The CLI tracks instances across your system, supports multiple AI providers and
models, and outputs in formats designed for both human readability and
programmatic use.

- Create, monitor, and manage AI coding tasks from the terminal
- Run multiple Cline instances simultaneously with independent configurations
- Automatically track and manage Cline instances across your system
- Support for both interactive and automated (YOLO) modes
- Choose between rich terminal output, JSON for scripting, or plain text
- Seamlessly integrate with Unix pipes and command-line workflows
- Save and restore task states at any point in time

## Installation

You can install the Cline CLI using one of the following methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NPM">
    ```bash
    npm install -g cline
    ```
    
    Install Cline CLI globally using npm. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Install Script">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cline/cline/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
    ```
    
    This script will download and install the latest version of Cline CLI and automatically update your shell configuration to include the CLI on your PATH.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Authentication

Before getting started, you'll want to authenticate with your Cline account.

```bash
cline auth
```

This starts an authentication wizard to get you signed in and set up with your
preferred AI model provider.

## Quick Start

The simplest way to use Cline is with instant task mode - just provide a prompt:

```bash
cline "Create a Python script that prints hello world"
```

Cline will automatically:
1. Spawn a new instance
2. Create a task with your prompt
3. Enter interactive chat mode

Or, if you'd like to ask Cline to complete a task in a single command, use the
`--yolo` flag:

```bash
cline --yolo "Create a Python script that prints hello world"
```

You can also pipe content from files or other commands:

```bash
# Pipe a file
cat requirements.txt | cline

# Use YOLO mode for full automation
echo "Create a todo app" | cline --yolo
```

Or run with no arguments to enter interactive mode:

```bash
cline
```

### Working with Modes

Cline operates in two modes:

**Plan Mode** (default): Cline gathers context, explores the codebase, and
creates a detailed plan before implementation.

**Act Mode**: Cline actively uses tools to accomplish tasks - reading files,
writing code, executing commands, using a browser, and more.

Switch between modes during a task:

```bash
# In interactive mode, use slash commands
/act    # Switch to Act mode
/plan   # Switch to Plan mode
```

Or specify the mode when starting:

```bash
cline "Build a feature" --mode act
```
