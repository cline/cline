## What is Cline CLI?

Cline CLI brings AI-powered coding agents to your terminal. Run multiple Cline
instances simultaneously, automate code reviews in CI/CD pipelines, pipe git
diffs directly to Cline for analysis, or script complex workflows that integrate
with your existing tools.

The CLI tracks instances across your system, supports multiple AI providers and
models, and outputs in formats designed for both human readability and
programmatic use.

- Create, monitor, and manage AI coding tasks from the terminal
- Run multiple Cline instances simultaneously with independent configurations
- Automatically track and manage Cline instances across your system
- Support for both interactive and automated (YOLO) modes
- Choose between rich terminal output, JSON for scripting, or plain text
- Seamlessly integrate with Unix pipes and command-line workflows
- Save and restore task states at any point in time

## Installation

You can install the Cline CLI using one of the following methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="NPM">
    ```bash
    npm install -g cline
    ```
    
    Install Cline CLI globally using npm. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Install Script">
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cline/cline/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
    ```
    
    This script will download and install the latest version of Cline CLI and automatically update your shell configuration to include the CLI on your PATH.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quick Start

Authenticate first to get access to all models:

```bash
cline auth
```

This opens a browser window to sign in. Once authenticated, navigate to your
project directory and start a Cline instance:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
cline
```

The instance registers automatically and you'll see an interactive prompt. Type
your task description:

```bash
"Build a REST API with Go"
```

Cline starts in Plan mode by default. He'll gather context and create a detailed
plan. Once you're satisfied with the plan, switch to Act mode to execute it:

```bash
/act
```

Watch as Cline generates code, creates files, and implements your task. Send
followup messages anytime:

```bash
"Add authentication middleware"
```

That's it. You're running Cline from the terminal now.

## Command Overview

```
A command-line interface for interacting with Cline AI coding assistant.

This CLI provides access to Cline's task management, configuration, and
monitoring capabilities from the terminal.

Usage:
  cline [command]

Available Commands:
  auth        Sign in to Cline
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  instance    Manage Cline instances
  logs        Manage Cline log files
  send        Send a followup message to the current task and/or update mode/approve
  task        Manage Cline tasks
  version     Show version information

Flags:
      --address string         Cline Core gRPC address (default "localhost:50052")
  -f, --file strings           attach files
  -h, --help                   help for cline
  -i, --image strings          attach image files
  -m, --mode string            mode (act|plan) - defaults to plan (default "plan")
  -o, --output-format string   output format (rich|json|plain) (default "rich")
  -s, --setting strings        task settings (key=value format)
  -v, --verbose                verbose output
  -w, --workdir strings        workdir directory paths
  -y, --yolo                   enable yolo mode (non-interactive)

Use "cline [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Use Cases

### Multi-Instance Workflow

Run multiple Cline instances simultaneously to work on different tasks in
parallel. Each instance gets a unique port and maintains its own state. Direct
commands to specific instances with `--address` or set a default instance for
convenience.

```bash
# Start multiple instances
cline instance new  # Gets port 51051
cline instance new  # Gets port 51052
cline instance new  # Gets port 51053

# List all instances
cline instance list

# Use specific instance for a task
cline task new "Task A" --address localhost:51051
cline task new "Task B" --address localhost:51052

# Set default instance
cline instance use localhost:51052

# Now commands go to 51052 by default
cline task new "Task C"

# Clean up
cline instance kill --all-cli
```

### Pipeline Integration

These examples show how Cline CLI integrates with Unix pipes and command-line
workflows. You can pipe content directly into Cline, capture output for further
processing, or combine Cline with other developer tools like `git`, `jq`, or
custom scripts.

This makes Cline CLI perfect for automation scenarios, CI/CD pipelines, code
review workflows, or any situation where you need to programmatically generate,
analyze, or transform code.

```bash
# Use with pipes
cat prompt.txt | cline task oneshot

# Generate code and pipe to file
cline task oneshot "Create a function" | tee output.log

# Combine with other tools
git diff | cline task new "Review these changes"
```
