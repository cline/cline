## What is Cline CLI?

Cline CLI runs AI coding agents directly in your terminal. Pipe git diffs for automated code reviews in CI/CD, run multiple instances simultaneously for parallel development, or integrate Cline into your existing shell workflows.

The CLI tracks instances across your system and outputs in formats designed for both humans and scriptsâ€”JSON, plain text, or rich terminal output.

## What you can build with this

The CLI's design opens up creative possibilities:

**Automated code maintenance**
- Schedule daily runs to identify and fix linting issues across your codebase
- Create tasks that scan for security vulnerabilities and automatically patch them
- Build scripts that update deprecated dependencies and run tests

**Multi-instance development**
- Run separate Cline instances for frontend and backend simultaneously
- Spawn instances for different feature branches, each with isolated state
- Create parallel review processes for multiple PRs

**Custom workflows**
- Build shell scripts that combine Cline with git hooks for pre-commit analysis
- Create custom commands that pipe complex data structures through Cline for processing
- Integrate with your existing toolchain (jq, grep, awk) for sophisticated automation

**CI/CD integration**
- Add Cline to GitHub Actions for automatic code review on every PR
- Create GitLab pipelines that generate migration scripts from schema changes
- Build Jenkins jobs that use Cline to analyze test failures and suggest fixes
