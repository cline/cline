description: Automatically respond to GitHub issues using Cline CLI in GitHub Actions
---

Automatically respond to GitHub issues by mentioning `@cline` in comments. This sample uses Cline CLI in GitHub Actions to create an AI-powered issue assistant that analyzes and responds to issues autonomously.

## CLI Features Used

- `cline instance new` - Create a new Cline instance
- `cline config set` - Configure API keys and settings
- `-y` / `--yolo` - Yolo mode (non-interactive, auto-approves all actions)
- `--mode act` - Act mode to actively investigate
- `--address` - Specify which Cline instance to use
- `-F json` - JSON output format for parsing

## Input

- GitHub issue comments containing `@cline` mentions
- Issue context and history

## Output

Automated analysis posted as a new comment on the issue.

## Example Usage

Simply mention `@cline` in any issue comment:

```
@cline what's causing this error?

@cline analyze the root cause

@cline what are the security implications?
```

## Sample Output

When you mention `@cline` in an issue comment, it automatically analyzes the issue and posts a detailed response:

```
## Analysis Results

I've analyzed issue #123 and here are my findings:

### Root Cause
The error occurs because [detailed analysis of the underlying problem]...

### Technical Details
- The issue stems from [specific code or configuration problem]
- This affects [impacted components or functionality]
- The error manifests when [triggering conditions]

### Recommended Solutions
1. [Primary solution with implementation approach]
2. [Alternative approach with trade-offs]
3. [Quick fix for immediate mitigation]

### Next Steps
[Actionable recommendations for resolving the issue]
```

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Actions detects** `@cline` mention in issue comment
2. **Workflow installs** Cline CLI and creates an instance
3. **Configures authentication** with API keys
4. **Downloads and runs** the analysis script (from github-issue-rca sample)
5. **Posts Cline's analysis** as a new comment

## Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow:
- Triggers on issue comment creation or editing
- Checks if the comment contains `@cline`
- Sets up Node.js and installs Cline CLI
- Creates a new Cline instance
- Configures API credentials from repository secrets
- Runs the analysis script with the issue URL
- Posts the results back to the issue

## Key Features

- **Automated responses** - No manual intervention required
- **Context-aware** - Analyzes the full issue context
- **Secure** - Uses GitHub secrets for API keys
- **Scalable** - Works across all issues in your repository
- **Customizable** - Easily modify the analysis prompt

## Setup & Documentation

For complete setup instructions, workflow configuration, and implementation details, see the [github-integration README](https://github.com/cline/cline/tree/main/src/samples/cli/github-integration).
