## Prerequisites

Cline CLI requires Node.js version 20 or higher. We recommend using Node.js 22 for the best experience.

To check your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g cline
```

After installation, authenticate with your Cline account:

```bash
cline auth
```

This starts an authentication wizard to sign you in and configure your preferred AI model provider.

## Quick Start

Get started with Cline in seconds:

```bash
cline
```

That's it! Running `cline` in any directory starts an interactive session where you can chat with the AI agent. Type your task, review the plan, and type `/act` when ready to execute.

For even faster execution without interaction:

```bash
cline "Add unit tests to utils.js"
```

This runs Cline with a single command, perfect for quick tasks or automation.

<Tip>
New to Cline CLI? Start with interactive mode (`cline`) to see how it works. Once comfortable, explore [the three core flows](/cline-cli/three-core-flows) for advanced usage patterns.
