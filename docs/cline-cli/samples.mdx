This page provides an overview of sample implementations that demonstrate
various Cline CLI features and capabilities.

## GitHub Root Cause Analysis

**Description:** A command-line script that uses Cline's autonomous AI
capabilities to fetch, analyze, and identify root causes of GitHub issues. The
script outputs concise summaries by filtering JSON output.

**CLI Features Used:**
- `-y` / `--yolo` - Yolo mode (non-interactive, auto-approves all actions)
- `--mode act` - Act mode to actively investigate (reads files, runs commands,
  etc.)
- `--address` - Specify which Cline instance to use
- `-F json` - JSON output format for parsing

**Input:**
- GitHub issue URL (required)
- Custom analysis prompt (optional)
- Cline instance address (optional)

**Output:**
- Detailed text analysis of the issue including root cause identification and
  recommended solutions

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Basic usage
./analyze-issue.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123

# Custom prompt
./analyze-issue.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 "What is the security impact?"
```

**Sample Output:**
```
$ ./analyze-issue.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/2

**Root Cause Analysis of Issue #2: "setState isn't cutting it"**

After examining the GitHub issue and analyzing the Flutter counter codebase, 
I've identified the root cause of why setState() is insufficient for this 
project's needs:

## Current Implementation Problems
[details elided]

## Recommended Solutions

The issue mentions "Provider or Bloc" - both are excellent alternatives:

1. **Provider**: Simple, lightweight state management using InheritedWidget
2. **Bloc**: More structured approach with clear separation between events, 
   states, and business logic
3. **Riverpod**: Modern alternative to Provider with better performance
4. **GetX**: Full-featured solution with state management, routing, and 
   dependency injection

The current codebase needs refactoring to implement proper state management 
architecture to handle more complex state scenarios effectively.
```

## GitHub Integration (GitHub Actions)

**Description:** Automatically respond to GitHub issues by mentioning `@cline`
in comments. This sample uses Cline CLI in GitHub Actions to create an
AI-powered issue assistant that analyzes and responds to issues autonomously.

**CLI Features Used:**
- `cline instance new` - Create a new Cline instance
- `cline config set` - Configure API keys and settings
- `-y` / `--yolo` - Yolo mode (non-interactive, auto-approves all actions)
- `--mode act` - Act mode to actively investigate
- `--address` - Specify which Cline instance to use
- `-F json` - JSON output format for parsing

**Input:**
- GitHub issue comments containing `@cline` mentions
- Issue context and history

**Output:**
- Automated analysis posted as a new comment on the issue

**Example Usage:** Simply mention `@cline` in any issue comment:
```
@cline what's causing this error?

@cline analyze the root cause

@cline what are the security implications?
```

**Sample Output:**

When you mention `@cline` in an issue comment, it automatically analyzes the issue and posts a detailed response:

```
## Analysis Results

I've analyzed issue #123 and here are my findings:

### Root Cause
The error occurs because [detailed analysis of the underlying problem]...

### Technical Details
- The issue stems from [specific code or configuration problem]
- This affects [impacted components or functionality]
- The error manifests when [triggering conditions]

### Recommended Solutions
1. [Primary solution with implementation approach]
2. [Alternative approach with trade-offs]
3. [Quick fix for immediate mitigation]

### Next Steps
[Actionable recommendations for resolving the issue]
```

**How It Works:**
1. GitHub Actions detects `@cline` mention in issue comment
2. Workflow installs Cline CLI and creates an instance
3. Configures authentication with API keys
4. Downloads and runs the analysis script (from github-issue-rca sample)
5. Posts Cline's analysis as a new comment
