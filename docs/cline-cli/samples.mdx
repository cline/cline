# CLI Samples

This page provides an overview of sample implementations that demonstrate
various Cline CLI features and capabilities.

## GitHub Root Cause Analysis

**Description:** A command-line script that uses Cline's autonomous AI
capabilities to fetch, analyze, and identify root causes of GitHub issues. The
script outputs concise summaries by filtering JSON output.

**CLI Features Used:**
- `-y` / `--yolo` - Yolo mode (non-interactive, auto-approves all actions)
- `--mode act` - Act mode to actively investigate (reads files, runs commands,
  etc.)
- `--address` - Specify which Cline instance to use
- `-F json` - JSON output format for parsing

**Input:**
- GitHub issue URL (required)
- Custom analysis prompt (optional)
- Cline instance address (optional)

**Output:**
- Detailed text analysis of the issue including root cause identification and
  recommended solutions

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Basic usage
./analyze-issue.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123

# Custom prompt
./analyze-issue.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123 "What is the security impact?"
```

**Setup & Documentation:** [github-issue-rca

## GitHub Integration (GitHub Actions)

**Description:** Automatically respond to GitHub issues by mentioning `@cline`
in comments. This sample uses Cline CLI in GitHub Actions to create an
AI-powered issue assistant that analyzes and responds to issues autonomously.

**CLI Features Used:**
- `cline instance new` - Create a new Cline instance
- `cline config set` - Configure API keys and settings
- `-y` / `--yolo` - Yolo mode (non-interactive, auto-approves all actions)
- `--mode act` - Act mode to actively investigate
- `--address` - Specify which Cline instance to use
- `-F json` - JSON output format for parsing

**Input:**
- GitHub issue comments containing `@cline` mentions
- Issue context and history

**Output:**
- Automated analysis posted as a new comment on the issue

**Example Usage:** Simply mention `@cline` in any issue comment:
```
@cline what's causing this error?

@cline analyze the root cause

@cline what are the security implications?
```

**How It Works:**
1. GitHub Actions detects `@cline` mention in issue comment
2. Workflow installs Cline CLI and creates an instance
3. Configures authentication with API keys
4. Downloads and runs the analysis script (from github-issue-rca sample)
5. Posts Cline's analysis as a new comment
