Cline CLI runs AI coding agents directly in your terminal. Pipe git diffs for automated code reviews in CI/CD, run multiple instances simultaneously, or integrate Cline into your existing shell workflows.

<Warning>
**Preview Release**: Cline CLI is currently in preview and only available for macOS and Linux. Windows support is coming soon.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Node.js version 20 or higher is required. We recommend Node.js 22.

```bash
node --version
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g cline
```

## Authentication

After installation, authenticate with your Cline account:

```bash
cline auth
```

This starts a wizard to sign you in and configure your preferred AI model provider.

## Quick Start

Start an interactive session:

```bash
cline
```

That's it! Type your task, review the plan, and type `/act` when ready to execute.

For headless execution:

```bash
cline "Add unit tests to utils.js"
```

<Tip>
New to Cline CLI? Start with interactive mode to see how it works. Once comfortable, explore [the three core flows](/cline-cli/three-core-flows) for advanced usage.

## Supported Providers

Cline CLI supports multiple AI model providers:

- Anthropic
- OpenAI
- OpenAI Compatible
- OpenRouter
- X AI (Grok)
- AWS Bedrock
- Google Gemini
- Ollama
- Cerebras

## What You Can Build

### Automated Code Maintenance
- Schedule daily runs to fix linting issues
- Scan for security vulnerabilities and auto-patch
- Update deprecated dependencies and run tests

### Multi-Instance Development
- Run separate instances for frontend and backend
- Spawn instances for different feature branches
- Parallel review processes for multiple PRs

### CI/CD Integration
- Add Cline to GitHub Actions for automatic code review
- Generate migration scripts from schema changes
- Analyze test failures and suggest fixes

### Custom Workflows
- Combine Cline with git hooks for pre-commit analysis
- Pipe complex data through Cline for processing
- Integrate with jq, grep, awk for sophisticated automation

## Hooks Integration

[Hooks](/customization/hooks) work with the CLI for validation and policy enforcement:

```bash
# Enable hooks for a task
cline "What does this repo do?" -s hooks_enabled=true

# Configure hooks globally
cline config set hooks-enabled=true
```
