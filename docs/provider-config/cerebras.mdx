Cerebras delivers the world's fastest AI inference through their revolutionary wafer-scale chip architecture. Unlike traditional GPUs that shuttle model weights from external memory, Cerebras stores entire models on-chip, eliminating bandwidth bottlenecks and achieving speeds up to 2,600 tokens per second—often 20x faster than GPUs.

### Cerebras's Wafer-Scale Advantage

Cerebras has fundamentally reimagined AI hardware architecture to solve the inference speed problem:

#### Wafer-Scale Architecture
Traditional GPUs use separate chips for compute and memory, forcing them to constantly shuttle model weights back and forth. Cerebras built the world's largest AI chip—a wafer-scale engine that stores entire models on-chip. No external memory, no bandwidth bottlenecks, no waiting.

#### Revolutionary Speed
- **Up to 2,600 tokens per second** - often 20x faster than GPUs
- **Single-second reasoning** - what used to take minutes now happens instantly
- **Real-time applications** - reasoning models become practical for interactive use
- **No bandwidth limits** - entire models stored on-chip eliminate memory bottlenecks

#### The Cerebras Scaling Law
Cerebras discovered that **faster inference enables smarter AI**. Modern reasoning models generate thousands of tokens as "internal monologue" before answering. On traditional hardware, this takes too long for real-time use. Cerebras makes reasoning models fast enough for everyday applications.

#### Quality Without Compromise
Unlike other speed optimizations that sacrifice accuracy, Cerebras maintains full model quality while delivering unprecedented speed. You get the intelligence of frontier models with the responsiveness of lightweight ones.
