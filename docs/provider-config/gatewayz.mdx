### Getting an API Key

1. Sign up or sign in at the Gatewayz console.
2. Find API keys under the account or developer section.
3. Create a key (name it e.g. "Cline") and copy it.

### Configuration in Cline

1. Open Cline settings.
2. Choose "Gatewayz" from the API Provider dropdown.
3. Paste your Gatewayz API key into the "Gatewayz API Key" field.
4. (Optional) Enable a custom base URL and paste your Gatewayz endpoint.
5. Select a model from the Model dropdown.

### Notes

- Gatewayz exposes a unified OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Cline uses the OpenAI client to connect. If Gatewayz requires special headers, request parameters, or a model naming pattern, we can adjust the handler to match.
- Monitor Gatewayz billing. Cline creates usage chunks but prices in docs/provider-config reflect placeholders; update with Gatewayz pricing when available.
