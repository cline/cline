Cline supports accessing models directly through the official OpenAI API.

**Website:** [https://openai.com/](https://openai.com/)

### Getting an API Key

1.  **Sign Up/Sign In:** Visit the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/). You'll need to create an account or sign in if you already have one.
2.  **Navigate to API Keys:** Once logged in, go to the [API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) of your account.
3.  **Create a Key:** Click on "Create new secret key". It's good practice to give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Cline API Key").
4.  **Copy the Key:** **Crucial:** Copy the generated API key immediately. For security reasons, OpenAI will not show it to you again. Store this key in a safe and secure location.
