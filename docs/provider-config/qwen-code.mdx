The Qwen Code provider lets you use Qwen's coding-specialized models with Cline through OAuth authentication. You get 2,000 free requests per day with 1M token context windows.

## Setup

First, you'll need to install and authenticate Qwen Code on your system:

1. **Install Qwen Code**: Install the official Qwen Code CLI tool
   ```bash
   npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code@latest
   ```

2. **Authenticate**: Run the authentication command and follow the browser prompts
   ```bash
   qwen
   ```
   This will save OAuth credentials to `~/.qwen/oauth_creds.json`.

3. **Configure in Cline**:
    - Open Cline settings (⚙️ icon)
    - Select **Qwen Code** from the **API Provider** dropdown
    - Set the OAuth credentials path to `~/.qwen/oauth_creds.json` (or your custom path)

### Finding your OAuth credentials

If you're not sure where your Qwen Code credentials are stored:

- **Default location**: `~/.qwen/oauth_creds.json`
- **Check if file exists**: 
  - **macOS/Linux**: `ls -la ~/.qwen/oauth_creds.json`
  - **Windows**: `dir %USERPROFILE%\.qwen\oauth_creds.json`

## Supported Models

The Qwen Code provider supports these models:

- `qwen3-coder-plus` (Recommended)
- `qwen3-coder-flash`

## How it works

When you use Qwen Code with Cline, here's what happens behind the scenes:

Cline wraps the Qwen Code CLI to handle your requests. Each time you send a message, Cline starts a new `qwen` process, sends your conversation, and streams the response back. The AI reasoning comes from Qwen Code, but all the actual file editing, terminal commands, and other tools are handled by Cline.

The main difference you'll notice is that responses don't stream character-by-character like other providers. Instead, Qwen Code processes your full request before sending back the complete response.

## Limitations

There are a few things to keep in mind with Qwen Code:

- Images in your messages get converted to text placeholders since Qwen Code doesn't support image uploads through the CLI
- Prompt caching isn't available with this provider
- Responses don't stream in real-time like other providers
- 2,000 requests per day limit (resets at midnight UTC)
- 60 requests per minute rate limit

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues:

**Authentication problems**: Make sure you're logged into Qwen Code with your account. Run `qwen` to re-authenticate if needed.

**Path issues**: Double-check that the OAuth credentials path in Cline's settings is correct. Verify the file exists at `~/.qwen/oauth_creds.json`.

**Rate limit issues**: You've hit the 60 requests/minute or 2,000 requests/day limit. Wait for the limits to reset.
