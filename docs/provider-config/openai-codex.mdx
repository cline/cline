OpenAI Codex lets you connect your OpenAI account directly to Cline using OAuth, meaning you don't need to manage API keys. Simply sign in with your OpenAI account through a one-click browser authentication, and you'll automatically have access to all the models available on your OpenAI plan. No additional configuration required. 

<Tip>
If you prefer to use API keys instead, see the [OpenAI (API Key)](/provider-config/openai) provider configuration.
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

- An [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
- An active OpenAI subscription or API access plan

<Note>
The models available to you depend on your OpenAI account's subscription tier. See [OpenAI's pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing) for details on what's included in each plan.
</Note>

## Connecting Your OpenAI Account

  <Step title="Open Cline Settings">

<Note>
If a model doesn't appear in your dropdown, it may not be available on your OpenAI subscription tier.

## Managing Your Connection

### Disconnecting Your Account

To disconnect your OpenAI account from Cline:

1. Open Cline Settings
2. With OpenAI Codex selected as the provider, click **"Sign out"**
3. Confirm the disconnection

This removes the OAuth connection. You can reconnect at any time by signing in again.

### Token Refresh

OAuth tokens are automatically refreshed by Cline. If you encounter authentication errors:

1. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your account
2. Ensure your OpenAI account is in good standing
3. Check that your subscription is active

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" error

- Ensure you're signing in with the correct OpenAI account
- Check that your OpenAI subscription is active
- Try clearing your browser cache and signing in again

### Models not appearing

- The available models depend on your OpenAI subscription tier
- Some models may require specific plan upgrades
- Check [OpenAI's pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing) for model availability by plan

### OAuth window doesn't open

- Check if pop-ups are blocked in your browser
- Try using a different browser
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection

### Connection keeps expiring

- This is rare but can happen if your OpenAI account session expired
- Disconnect and reconnect to refresh your authentication

## Good to Know

Cline only requests the permissions necessary to make API calls on your behalf. Your OpenAI credentials are never stored by Cline.

When using OpenAI Codex, Cline accesses models through your OpenAI/ChatGPT subscription. There is no separate per-token API billing or consumption of OpenAI API credits for this provider; usage and limits are governed by your ChatGPT (or OpenAI account) subscription plan, not by Cline.
