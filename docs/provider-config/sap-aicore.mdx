### Getting a Service Binding

> 💡 **Information**
>
> SAP AI Core, and Generative AI Hub, are offerings from SAP BTP.
> You need an active SAP BTP contract and a existing subaccount with a SAP AI Core instance to perform these steps.

1. **Access:** Go to your subaccount via [BTP Cloud Cockpit](cockpit.btp.cloud.sap/cockpit)
2. **Create a Service Binding:** Go to "Instances and Subscriptions", select your SAP AI Core service instance and click on Service Bindings > Create.
3. **Copy the Service Binding:** Copy the service binding values.

### Supported Models

SAP AI Core supports a large and growing number of models.
Refer to the [Generative AI Hub Supported Models page](https://me.sap.com/notes/3437766) for the complete and up-to-date list.

### Configuration in Cline

1.  **Open Cline Settings:** Click the settings icon (⚙️) in the Cline panel.
2.  **Select Provider:** Choose "SAP AI Core" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3.  **Enter Client Id:** Add the `.clientid` field from the service binding into the "AI Core Client Id" field.
4.  **Enter Client Secret:** Add the `.clientsecret` field from the service binding into the "AI Core Client Secret" field.
5.  **Enter Base URL:** Add the `.serviceurls.AI_API_URL` field from the service binding into the "AI Core Base URL" field.
6.  **Enter Auth URL:** Add the `.url` field from the service binding into the "AI Core Auth URL" field.
7.  **Enter Resource Group:** Add the resource group where you have your model deployments. See [Create a Deployment for a Generative AI Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-generative-ai-model-in-sap-ai-core).
8.  **Configure Orchestration Mode:** The "Orchestration Mode" checkbox is enabled by default (recommended). This uses the harmonized API that provides access to all available models without requiring individual deployments, making it much simpler to use.
9.  **Select Model:** Choose your desired model from the "Model" dropdown.

### Orchestration Mode vs Native API

**Orchestration Mode (Default - Recommended):**
- **Enabled by default:** Uses the harmonized API layer
- **Simplified usage:** No need to deploy individual models
- **Broader access:** Provides access to all available models through a unified interface
- **Easier management:** Handles model routing and availability automatically

**Native API Mode:**
- **Fallback option:** For users who specifically want to interface directly with AI Core instead of the orchestration layer
- **Direct control:** Requires individual model deployments in your resource group
- **Advanced features:** May support some specialized features not available in the harmonized API
- **More complex:** Requires manual deployment and management of each model you want to use

> 💡 **Recommendation**
>
> Keep Orchestration Mode enabled unless you have specific requirements that necessitate direct AI Core API access or need features not supported by the harmonized API.

### Tips and Notes

-   **Model Selection:** The model dropdown displays models in two separate lists:
    -   **Deployed Models:** These models are already deployed in your specified resource group and are ready to use immediately.
    -   **Not Deployed Models:** These models don't have active deployments in your specified resource group. You won't be able to use these models until you create deployments for them in SAP AI Core.
-   **Creating Deployments:** To use a not deployed model, you'll need to create a deployment in your resource group in sap ai core service instance. See [Create a Deployment for a Generative AI Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-generative-ai-model-in-sap-ai-core) for instructions.
