description: Use Cline with 2,000+ models that Portkey supports with enterprise-grade model access, governance, guardrails, and observability
---

## Overview

[Portkey](https://portkey.ai/) turns Cline into a **multi-model, enterprise-ready** workspace by providing one OpenAI-compatible gateway for 2,000+ LLMs and layering rich observability, governance, and security on every request.

### Why use Portkey with Cline?

- **Unified AI Gateway:** Consolidate Cline traffic through one endpoint that supports multiple LLMs/providers
- **Observability:** Real-time usage dashboards, structured logs, 40+ metrics, and request tracing
- **Governance & Cost control:** Budgets, RBAC, API-key lifecycle management, and spend tracking
- **Security guardrails:** PII detection, content filtering, jailbreak protection, and compliance controls

### Typical Scenarios

- **Multi-cloud / multi-vendor:** Quickly switch models across vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local) without changing your Cline workflow.
- **Enterprise compliance:** Need audit trails, RBAC, or per-team budgets on top of raw model access.
- **Self-hosted gateway:** Run Portkey on-prem or in your VPC to keep traffic within your network boundaries.
- **Advanced routing:** Experiment with ensemble or fallback routing between models using Portkey's policies.

## Prerequisites

- A Portkey account and an API key

### Getting a Portkey API Key

1. Sign up or log in at the [Portkey Console](https://app.portkey.ai/).
2. Navigate to **"API Keys"** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **"Create Key"** (or copy an existing one) and give it a descriptive name like "Cline".
4. Copy the key!

## Configuration in Cline

1. Open Cline Settings → API Provider
2. Select "Portkey"
3. Fill in the fields:

- **Gateway URL (optional)**: Defaults to `https://api.portkey.ai/v1` OR add your self-hosted Portkey Gateway URL
- **Portkey API Key**: Your Portkey API key [from here](https://app.portkey.ai/)
- **Model ID**: Choose from the dropdown

When both Gateway URL and API key are present, Cline will fetch available models for you automatically.

### Supported Models

Portkey exposes every model listed in your [model catalog](https://app.portkey.ai/model-catalog/models) through a single endpoint.  Cline will automatically fetch the list for you once **Gateway URL** and **API Key** are provided, so you can simply pick the model from the dropdown.  
If a model is missing from the dropdown, paste its full ID manually (e.g. `anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240229`).

### Notes

- Portkey is implemented using the OpenAI‑compatible backend in Cline, so no additional setup is required beyond providing base URL and API key
- You can point Cline to a self‑hosted Portkey gateway by replacing the default Gateway URL

## Using Portkey with Cline

Once configured:

- Start tasks as usual in Cline; requests will route via your Portkey gateway
- You’ll get Portkey’s enterprise features (observability, governance, guardrails) without changing your Cline workflow

## Troubleshooting

- Verify that your **Gateway URL** is reachable; open it in the browser – you should see a JSON greeting.
- Check that the **API Key** has the correct scopes (Model Access).
- Open **Portkey → Logs** in the console to inspect request/response details.

## Support

- **Portkey Community:** [Discord](https://portkey.wiki/community) or the in-app chat.
