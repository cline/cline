### Configuration in Cline

1.  **Open Cline Settings:** Click the settings icon (⚙️) in the Cline panel.
2.  **Select Provider:** Choose "Google Gemini" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3.  **Enter API Key:** Paste your Google AI API key into the "Gemini API Key" field.
4.  **Select Model:** Choose your desired model from the "Model" dropdown.

### Thinking / Reasoning Support

Gemini 3 and 2.5 models support thinking/reasoning capabilities:

-   **Gemini 3 Pro/Flash:** Support thinking levels (`low`, `high`) that control reasoning depth
-   **Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash:** Support thinking budgets that cap the number of thinking tokens

Enable extended thinking in Cline settings to leverage these capabilities for complex coding and reasoning tasks.

### Tips and Notes

-   **Large Context Windows:** Gemini models offer up to 2M token context windows, making them excellent for large codebases and document analysis.
-   **Prompt Caching:** Gemini 2.5+ and select 2.0 models support prompt caching for reduced costs on repeated queries.
-   **Image Support:** All Gemini models support image inputs for multimodal tasks.
-   **Tiered Pricing:** Some models have tiered pricing based on context usage (e.g., lower prices under 200K tokens).
-   **Free Experimental Models:** Many experimental models are available at no cost during their preview period.
-   **Pricing:** Refer to the [Google AI pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models/gemini) for the latest information.
