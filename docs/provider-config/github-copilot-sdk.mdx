---

Beadsmith includes a **GitHub Copilot SDK** provider powered by the Copilot CLI runtime. This is useful when you want to run Copilot outside of the VS Code Language Model API flow.

### Prerequisites

- **Copilot CLI installed** and available on your PATH.
- **GitHub Copilot subscription** (Copilot CLI will validate your account).

### Configuration Steps

1. Open Beadsmith **Settings** and select **GitHub Copilot SDK** as the provider.
2. (Optional) Set **Copilot CLI Path** if the binary is not on your PATH.
3. (Optional) Set **Copilot CLI URL** if you already run a Copilot CLI server and want to connect to it.
4. (Optional) Add a **GitHub token** if you do not want to rely on your logged-in user.
5. Set a **Model ID** supported by your Copilot CLI account.

### Notes

- If **Copilot CLI URL** is set, Beadsmith will connect to that server and ignore local CLI path/auth options.
- This provider currently disables Copilot CLI tool access and only uses model responses. Beadsmith tools are still available.
