Meet Cline, an AI assistant that lives in your terminal.

Cline can handle complex software development tasks step-by-step. With tools that let him create & edit files, explore large projects, use the browser, and execute terminal commands (after you grant permission), he can assist you in ways that go beyond code completion or tech support.

```bash
npm i -g cline

# cd into your project and run:
cline
```

> Move your mouse around under the Cline icon for a surprise!

### Use any API and Model

Cline supports API providers like ChatGPT, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, GCP Vertex, Cerebras and Groq. You can also configure any OpenAI compatible API, or use a local model through LM Studio/Ollama. If you're using a Cline Account, you'll always have access to the newest models as soon as they're available.

### Stay in Control with Human-in-the-Loop

Cline asks for your approval before running commands, editing files, or taking any action. Review each step and approve or reject as you go—or enable auto-approve to let Cline work autonomously to completion.

### Plan & Act Modes

Toggle to Plan Mode to discuss implementation and architecture with Cline. He'll ask clarifying questions, explore your codebase, and present a plan for you to align on. Once you're satisfied, switch to Act Mode and let Cline execute the plan.
