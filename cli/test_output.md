# Cline CLI Test Report

## Project Analysis Summary

### Overview
The Cline CLI is a comprehensive command-line interface for an AI-powered coding assistant built in Go. It provides autonomous coding capabilities with multi-model support and extensive features.

### Key Findings

#### Architecture
- **Main Command**: `cmd/cline/main.go` - Entry point with Cobra CLI framework
- **Package Structure**: Well-organized under `pkg/cli/` with dedicated modules for:
  - Authentication (`auth/`)
  - Configuration management (`config/`)
  - Task management (`task/`)
  - Display rendering (`display/`)
  - Global state management (`global/`)

#### Core Features Discovered
1. **Multi-mode Operation**: Plan mode vs Act mode
2. **Provider Support**: Multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)
3. **Interactive & Batch Modes**: Both command-line args and interactive prompts
4. **Output Formats**: Rich, JSON, and plain text output
5. **Instance Management**: Can start/stop/manage multiple instances
6. **Authentication Flow**: Comprehensive auth wizard with provider setup

#### Command Structure
Based on code analysis, the CLI supports these main commands:
- `cline` (root) - Start new task with prompt
- `cline auth` - Authentication and provider setup
- `cline task` - Task management (new, list, pause, etc.)
- `cline instance` - Instance management (list, kill, default)
- `cline config` - Configuration management
- `cline logs` - Log file management
- `cline doctor` - System diagnostics
- `cline version` - Version information

### Technical Implementation Notes
- Uses Cobra for CLI framework
- gRPC communication with core service
- Structured logging and error handling
- Multiple output formats with conditional JSON/plain text
- Interactive TUI elements using Charm libraries

### Test Results
✅ File reading capabilities - Successfully read multiple source files
✅ Code definition extraction - Listed all function definitions
✅ Search functionality - Tested regex search across codebase  
✅ File creation - Successfully created this test report
✅ Project structure analysis - Comprehensive understanding achieved
✅ Command execution - Successfully ran go commands
✅ Project build - Successfully built the Cline CLI binary

### Build Information
- Go version: go1.25.3 darwin/arm64
- Dependencies downloaded and tidied successfully
- Binary created at: `bin/cline`

## Test Completion
This comprehensive test has successfully demonstrated:
- File system operations (read, write, list, search)
- Code analysis and understanding
- Project compilation and build process
- Command execution capabilities
- Structured documentation generation

All major tool capabilities have been tested and verified working.
