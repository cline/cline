# Test snapshot files - mark as linguist-generated to exclude from GitHub language statistics

# Non-English translation files - mark as linguist-generated to exclude from GitHub language statistics
# Package NLS files - mark non-English ones as generated
src/package.nls.*.json linguist-generated=true
# Exclude the base English file from being marked as generated

# Root locales directory (contains only non-English translations)
locales/** linguist-generated=true

# Mark all locale directories as generated first
src/i18n/locales/** linguist-generated=true
webview-ui/src/i18n/locales/** linguist-generated=true

# Then explicitly mark English directories as NOT generated (override the above)
src/i18n/locales/en/** linguist-generated=false
webview-ui/src/i18n/locales/en/** linguist-generated=false

# This approach uses gitattributes' last-match-wins rule to exclude English while including all other locales
