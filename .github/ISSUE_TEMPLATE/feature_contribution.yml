              - Don't start implementation until the proposal is reviewed and approved

    - type: textarea
      id: problem-description
      attributes:
          label: What problem does this solve?
          description: |
              Describe the problem clearly from a user's point of view. Focus on why this matters, who it affects, and when it occurs.

              ‚úÖ Good examples:
              - "LLM provider returns 400 error when nearing the context window instead of truncating"
              - "Submit button is invisible in dark mode"
              - "Users can't easily share their Cline configurations with team members"

              ‚ùå Avoid vague descriptions:
              - "Performance is bad"
              - "UI needs work"

              Your description should include:
              - Who is affected?
              - When does it happen?
              - What's the current vs expected behavior?
              - What is the impact?
          placeholder: Be specific about the problem, who it affects, and the impact.
      validations:
          required: true

    - type: textarea
      id: proposed-solution
      attributes:
          label: What's the proposed solution?
          description: |
              Describe how the problem should be solved. Be specific about UX, system behavior, and any flows that would change.

              ‚úÖ Good examples:
              - "Add error handling immediately after attempting to create the llm stream and retry after manually truncating"
              - "Update button styling to ensure contrast in all themes"
              - "Add export/import functionality in settings with JSON format"

              ‚ùå Avoid vague solutions:
              - "Improve performance"
              - "Fix the bug"

              Your solution should include:
              - What exactly will change?
              - How will users interact with it?
              - What's the expected outcome?
          placeholder: Describe the proposed changes and how they solve the problem.
