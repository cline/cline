# Why-What-Acceptance (WWA)

Create product backlog items in Why-What-Acceptance format. Produces independent, valuable, testable items with strategic context.

**Use when:** Writing backlog items, creating product increments, breaking features into work items, or communicating strategic intent to teams.

**Arguments:**
- `$PRODUCT`: The product or system name
- `$FEATURE`: The new feature or capability
- `$DESIGN`: Link to design files (Figma, Miro, etc.)
- `$ASSUMPTIONS`: Key assumptions and strategic context

## Step-by-Step Process

1. **Define the strategic Why** - Connect work to business and team objectives
2. **Describe the What** - Keep descriptions concise, reference designs
3. **Write Acceptance Criteria** - High-level, not detailed specifications
4. **Ensure independence** - Items can be developed in any order
5. **Keep items negotiable** - Invite team conversation, not constraints
6. **Make items valuable** - Each delivers measurable user or business value
7. **Ensure testability** - Outcomes are observable and verifiable
8. **Size appropriately** - Small enough for one sprint estimate

## Item Template

**Title:** [What will be delivered]

**Why:** [1-2 sentences connecting to strategic context and team objectives]

**What:** [Short description and design link. 1-2 paragraphs maximum. A reminder of discussion, not detailed specification.]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [Observable outcome 1]
- [Observable outcome 2]
- [Observable outcome 3]
- [Observable outcome 4]

## Example WWA Item

**Title:** Implement Real-Time Spending Tracker

**Why:** Users need immediate feedback on spending to make conscious budget decisions. This directly supports our goal to improve financial awareness and reduce overspending.

**What:** Add a real-time spending tracker that updates as users log expenses. The tracker displays their current week's spending against their set budget. Designs available in [Figma link]. This is a reminder of our discussions - detailed specifications will emerge during development conversations with the team.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Spending totals update within 2 seconds of logging an expense
- Budget progress is visually indicated with a progress bar
- Users can see remaining budget amount at a glance
- System handles multiple expense categories correctly

## Output Deliverables

- Complete set of backlog items for the feature
- Each item includes Why, What, and Acceptance Criteria sections
- Items are independent and deliverable in any order
- Items are sized for estimation and completion in one sprint
- Strategic context is clear for team decision-making
- Design references are included for implementation guidance
