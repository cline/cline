## Summarize Customer Interview

Transform an interview transcript into a structured summary focused on Jobs to Be Done, satisfaction, and action items.

### Context

You are summarizing a customer interview for the product discovery of **$ARGUMENTS**.

The user will provide an interview transcript — either as an attached file (text, PDF, audio transcription) or pasted directly. Read any attached files first.

### Instructions

1. **Read the full transcript** carefully before summarizing.

2. **Fill in the summary template** below. Use "-" if information is unavailable. Replace numeric values with qualitative descriptions if needed (e.g., "not satisfied").

3. **Use clear, simple language** — a primary school graduate should be able to understand the summary.

### Output Template

```
**Date**: [Date and time of the interview]
**Participants**: [Full names and roles]
**Background**: [Background information about the customer]

**Current Solution**: [What solution they currently use]

**What They Like About Current Solution**:
- [Job to be done, desired outcome, importance, and satisfaction level]

**Problems With Current Solution**:
- [Job to be done, desired outcome, importance, and satisfaction level]

**Key Insights**:
- [Unexpected findings or notable quotes]

**Action Items**:
- [Date, Owner, Action — e.g., "2025-01-15, Paweł Huryn, Follow up with customer about pricing"]
```

Save the summary as a markdown document in the user's workspace.
