# Change Log

## [3.0.12]

- Fix DeepSeek API cost reporting (input price is 0 since it's all either a cache read or write, different than how Anthropic reports cache usage)

## [3.0.11]

- Emphasize auto-formatting done by the editor in file edit responses for more reliable diff editing

## [3.0.10]

- Add DeepSeek provider to API Provider options
- Fix context window limit errors for DeepSeek v3

## [3.0.9]

- Fix bug where DeepSeek v3 would incorrectly escape HTML entities in diff edits

## [3.0.8]

- Mitigate DeepSeek v3 diff edit errors by adding 'auto-formatting considerations' to system prompt, encouraging model to use updated file contents as reference point for SEARCH blocks

## [3.0.7]

- Revert to using batched file watcher to fix crash when many files would be created at once

## [3.0.6]

- Fix bug where some files would be missing in the `@` context mention menu
- Add Bedrock support in additional regions
- Diff edit improvements
- Add OpenRouter's middle-out transform for models that don't use prompt caching (prevents context window limit errors, but cannot be applied to models like Claude since it would continuously break the cache)

## [3.0.4]

- Fix bug where gemini models would add code block artifacts to the end of text content
- Fix context mention menu visual issues on light themes

## [3.0.2]

- Adds block anchor matching for more reliable diff edits (if 3+ lines, first and last line are used as anchors to search for)
- Add instruction to system prompt to use complete lines in diff edits to work properly with fallback strategies
- Improves diff edit error handling
- Adds new Gemini models

## [3.0.0]

- Cline now uses a search & replace diff based approach when editing large files to prevent code deletion issues.
- Adds support for a more comprehensive auto-approve configuration, allowing you to specify which tools require approval and which don't.
- Adds ability to enable system notifications for when Cline needs approval or completes a task.
- Adds support for a root-level `.clinerules` file that can be used to specify custom instructions for the project.

## [2.2.0]

- Add support for Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling Cline to use custom tools like web-search tool or GitHub tool
- Add MCP server management tab accessible via the server icon in the menu bar
- Add ability for Cline to dynamically create new MCP servers based on user requests (e.g., "add a tool that gets the latest npm docs")

## [2.1.6]

- Add LM Studio as an API provider option (make sure to start the LM Studio server to use it with the extension!)

## [2.1.5]

- Add support for prompt caching for new Claude model IDs on OpenRouter (e.g. `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620`)

## [2.1.4]

- AWS Bedrock fixes (add missing regions, support for cross-region inference, and older Sonnet model for regions where new model is not available)

- Misc. bug fixes
- Update README with new browser feature

## [2.1.1]

- Add stricter prompt to prevent Cline from editing files during a browser session without first closing the browser

## [2.1.0]

- Cline now uses Anthropic's new "Computer Use" feature to launch a browser, click, type, and scroll. This gives him more autonomy in runtime debugging, end-to-end testing, and even general web use. Try asking "Look up the weather in Colorado" to see it in action! (Available with Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2)

## [2.0.19]

- Fix model info for Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 on OpenRouter

## [2.0.5]
