# DEPRECATED

This framework is kept for backward compatibility but is scheduled for removal.

## Why It's Deprecated

1. **Narrow scope**: Tests diff schema compliance, not general model capability
2. **Better alternatives**: `cline-bench` provides real-world task evaluation
3. **Maintenance burden**: Requires manual test case generation from conversations

## If You're Using This

Contact @ara or @robin before this gets removed. We can help migrate your use case to the smoke tests or cline-bench framework.

## Removal Timeline

Target: Q2 2026 (or when cline-bench is fully operational for model comparison)
