**BUG TO FIX: GitHub Issue #7876 - Claude Sonnet 4.5 Thinking is on a single line**

**Problem Description:**
- When using Claude Sonnet 4.5 with Thinking/Extended thinking enabled, the thinking blocks display as one very long unreadable line instead of properly formatted text with newlines
- The thinking content should show properly formatted with line breaks, but instead all newlines are missing or not being rendered
- This makes the thinking output completely unreadable

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Do any task with Claude Sonnet 4.5 which involves Thinking steps
2. Observe the Thinking blocks - they have a single, very long line in them
3. Newlines are missing or not rendered

**Your Task:**
1. Search the codebase to find where thinking blocks are rendered in the UI
2. Look for components that handle Claude's thinking/extended thinking content
3. Find where the thinking text content is processed and displayed
4. Identify why newlines are being stripped or not rendered
5. Propose a fix that preserves newlines in the thinking block display
6. Show me the exact file(s) and code changes needed

Focus on files in src/webview or related UI components that render Claude API responses.
