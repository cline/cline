Fine-tuned via distillation from R1, it supports structured output (JSON mode) and function call syntax for agent-based applications.\n\nDeepHermes 3 supports a **reasoning toggle via system prompt**, allowing users to switch between fast, intuitive responses and deliberate, multi-step reasoning. When activated with the following specific system instruction, the model enters a *\"deep thinking\"* mode—generating extended chains of thought wrapped in `<think></think>` tags before delivering a final answer. \n\nSystem Prompt: You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering.

You can find all models in the Molmo family [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/allenai/molmo-66f379e6fe3b8ef090a8ca19). Learn more about the Molmo family [in the announcement blog post](https://molmo.allenai.org/blog) or the [paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2409.17146).\n\nMolmo 7B-D is based on [Qwen2-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-7B) and uses [OpenAI CLIP](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336) as vision backbone. It performs comfortably between GPT-4V and GPT-4o on both academic benchmarks and human evaluation.\n\nThis checkpoint is a preview of the Molmo release. All artifacts used in creating Molmo (PixMo dataset, training code, evaluations, intermediate checkpoints) will be made available at a later date, furthering our commitment to open-source AI development and reproducibility.",
