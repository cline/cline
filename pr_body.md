### Description

This PR introduces telemetry for MCP tool calls to monitor usage, success rates, and errors.

- Adds a new telemetry event 'task.mcp_tool_called'.
- Captures the server name, tool name, and status (started, success, error).
- Integrates telemetry calls into the McpHub to track tool execution lifecycle.

### Test Procedure

Manual testing was performed to ensure that the telemetry events are captured correctly when MCP tools are called.

1.  Connected a local MCP server.
2.  Executed a tool from the server.
3.  Verified that the 'task.mcp_tool_called' event was logged with the correct data (server name, tool name, and status).
4.  Verified that no sensitive argument values were logged.
