Tool uses are formatted using XML-style tags. The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags. Here's the structure:

<tool_name>
<parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
<parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
...
</tool_name>

For example:

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have completed the task...
</result>
</attempt_completion>

Always adhere to this format for all tool uses to ensure proper parsing and execution.`
