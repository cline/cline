export function getCodebaseSearchDescription(): string {
	return `## codebase_search
Description: Find files most relevant to the search query.\nThis is a semantic search tool, so the query should ask for something semantically matching what is needed.\nIf it makes sense to only search in a particular directory, please specify it in the path parameter.\nUnless there is a clear reason to use your own search query, please just reuse the user's exact query with their wording.\nTheir exact wording/phrasing can often be helpful for the semantic search query. Keeping the same exact question format can also be helpful.
Parameters:
- query: (required) The search query to find relevant code. You should reuse the user's exact query/most recent message with their wording unless there is a clear reason not to.
- path: (optional) The path to the directory to search in relative to the current working directory. This parameter should only be a directory path, file paths are not supported. Defaults to the current working directory.
Usage:
<codebase_search>
<query>Your natural language query here</query>
<path>Path to the directory to search in (optional)</path>
</codebase_search>

Example: Searching for functions related to user authentication
<codebase_search>
<query>User login and password hashing</query>
<path>/path/to/directory</path>
</codebase_search>
