/**
 * ## search_files
Description: Request to perform a regex search across files in a specified directory, providing context-rich results. This tool searches for patterns or specific content across multiple files, displaying each match with encapsulating context.
Parameters:
- path: (required) The path of the directory to search in (relative to the current working directory ${cwd.toPosix()}). This directory will be recursively searched.
- regex: (required) The regular expression pattern to search for. Uses Rust regex syntax.
- file_pattern: (optional) Glob pattern to filter files (e.g., '*.ts' for TypeScript files). If not provided, it will search all files (*).
Usage:
<search_files>
<path>Directory path here</path>
<regex>Your regex pattern here</regex>
<file_pattern>file pattern here (optional)</file_pattern>
</search_files>
