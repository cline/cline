/**
 * One-time migration from VSCode's ExtensionContext storage to file-backed stores.
 *
 * VSCode historically stored global state, workspace state, and secrets via the
 * ExtensionContext API (backed by SQLite under ~/.vscode/). This module migrates
 * that data to the shared file-backed stores in ~/.cline/data/ so all platforms
 * (VSCode, CLI, JetBrains) share the same persistence layer.
 *
 * ## Migration semantics
 *
 * - **Two independent sentinels** control migration:
 *   - `__migrationVersion` in the file-backed `globalState` gates global state + secrets.
 *   - `__migrationVersion` in the file-backed `workspaceState` gates per-workspace state.
 *   This ensures that when a new workspace is opened for the first time, its workspace
 *   state is still migrated even though globals+secrets were already exported previously.
 *
 * - **Merge strategy: file-backed store wins.** If a key already exists in the
 *   file store (e.g. because CLI or JetBrains wrote it), we do NOT overwrite.
 *   This prevents the migration from clobbering newer data written by another client.
 *
 * - VSCode storage is NOT cleared after migration. This ensures safe downgrade:
 *   if the user rolls back to an older extension version that doesn't know about
 *   file-backed stores, the old code path still works.
 *
 * - taskHistory is NOT migrated here — it already has its own file-based storage
 *   at ~/.cline/data/tasks/taskHistory.json that all platforms share.
