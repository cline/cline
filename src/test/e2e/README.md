# E2E Tests

This directory contains the end-to-end tests for the extension using Playwright. These tests simulate user interactions with the extension in a real VS Code environment.

## Running Tests

First, set up the test environment by running the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

To run all the E2E tests without re-doing the setup:

```bash
npm run e2e
```
