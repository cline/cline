As you gather more information or discover new requirements, update the todo list to reflect the current understanding of what needs to be accomplished.\n\n5. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and refine the todo list.\n\n6.

Please avoid using double quotes (\"\") and parentheses () inside square brackets ([]) in Mermaid diagrams, as this can cause parsing errors.\n\n7.
