Please use the scripts/git-list-prs-since-last-release.sh script to get a list of the PRs included in main on this repo since the last release, and dig deeper into each PR to understand the changes more deeply so that we can generate a concise set of changelog entries for the important changes that need to be surfaced while ignoring smaller changes that would simply be noise in the summarized changelog.  Come up with the complete summary changelog that I can use for this next upcoming release.  The final summary should consist of simple bullet points that are relevant to human readers and should be collated under the headers "Added", "Fixed", and "Changed"; it should simply list the things that are relevant to know and no more than that.  If there are two or more entries that should be combined into a single bullet point, please do so (for example if a general statement spanning two or three bullet points would be a more concise and still highly relevant way of grouping them).
