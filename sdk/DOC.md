## SSH remote environments

`RemoteEnvironmentService` (exported by `@cline/core` and `@cline/sdk`) owns SSH
profiles, connection testing, helper installation, authenticated loopback tunnels,
remote commands, status changes, and cleanup. It runs in the client's Node host;
browser clients expose this API through their host transport. No desktop code is
required. OpenSSH config aliases, identity files, and ssh-agent authentication are
supported. Connections use batch mode and require an already-trusted host key in
OpenSSH known_hosts (or `knownHostsPath`). Before first use, verify the server
fingerprint through a trusted channel and enroll it using your SSH client. Unknown
or changed keys are rejected before inspection, upload, or execution.

```ts
import { ClineCore, RemoteEnvironmentService } from "@cline/core";

const environments = new RemoteEnvironmentService({
  helperBinaryDirectory: "/opt/my-client/remote-helpers",
  onStatusChange: (status) => console.log(status),
});
const profile = await environments.upsert({ name: "Build host", host: "builder" });
const connection = await environments.connect(profile.id);
const core = await ClineCore.create({
  clientName: "my-client",
  backendMode: "remote",
  remote: {
    endpoint: connection.endpoint,
    authToken: connection.authToken,
    workspaceRoot: connection.workspaceRoot,
  },
});
try {
  // The ordinary session, tools, approvals, and event APIs execute on this host.
  // Supply provider credentials in the session config, as for other remote hubs.
  console.log(await core.list());
} finally {
  await core.dispose();
  await environments.dispose();
}
```

The service also exposes `list`, `upsert`, `delete`, `test`, `disconnect`, `run`,
`getConnection`, `getActive`, `activateConnection`, and `getStatuses`.
`onConnectionLost` lets clients retire runtime bindings after a tunnel fails.
Each service instance has a unique remote Hub discovery record, so another
client connecting to the same host cannot stop its Hub.
Connect/disconnect/profile mutations are serialized; concurrent connects reuse
one tunnel. Dispose the `ClineCore` runtime before disconnecting its environment.
Do not expose the connection's authentication token to a browser or logs.

Profiles default to `~/.cline/data/settings/remote-environments.json`, written
atomically with mode 0600. They contain identity-file paths, never private keys.
Options include `profilesPath`, `sshPath`, `knownHostsPath`, process timeouts,
`helperBinaryPath`, and `helperBinaryDirectory`. The corresponding helper/SSH
configuration variables are `CLINE_REMOTE_HELPER_BINARY`,
`CLINE_REMOTE_HELPER_DIRECTORY`, `CLINE_SSH_PATH`, and
`CLINE_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE`.

Clients package a matching self-contained helper using the
`@cline/core/remote/helper-entry` executable entrypoint, compiled with Bun for the remote OS and
architecture. Use `remoteHelperBinaryFilename({ platform, arch })` for the
filename (`cline-remote-helper-<target-triple>`). Linux and macOS on x64/arm64
are supported. Helpers must include the same SDK build as the client; missing
helpers produce an explicit error, without installing a runtime from the network.
The helper implements `--remote-hub-ensure --cwd <path> --discovery-path <path>`
and the core detached-daemon sentinel. Agent tools and persistence run remotely;
the host only manages SSH and forwards the authenticated hub connection.
