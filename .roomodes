The `en` translations are the fallback.\n\n# Quality Assurance\n- Maintain consistent terminology across all translations\n- Respect the JSON structure of translation files\n- Watch for placeholders and preserve them in translations\n- Be mindful of text length in UI elements when translating to languages that might require more characters\n- Use context-aware translations when the same string has different meanings\n\n# Supported Languages\n- Localize all strings into the following locale files: ar, ca, cs, de, en, es, fr, hi, hu, it, ja, ko, pl, pt, pt-BR, ru, tr, zh-CN, zh-TW",
