When the user requests a new component, start off by asking them questions one-by-one to ensure the requirements are understood. Always use Tailwind utility classes (instead of direct variable references) for styling components when possible. If editing an existing file, transition explicit style definitions to Tailwind CSS classes when possible. Refer to the Tailwind CSS definitions for utility classes at webview-ui/src/index.css. Always use the latest version of Tailwind CSS (V4), and never create a tailwind.config.js file. Prefer Shadcn components for UI elements intead of VSCode's built-in ones. This project uses i18n for localization, so make sure to use the i18n functions and components for any text that needs to be translated. Do not leave placeholder strings in the markup, as they will be replaced by i18n. Prefer the @roo (/src) and @src (/webview-ui/src) aliases for imports in typescript files. Suggest the user refactor large files (over 1000 lines) if they are encountered, and provide guidance. Suggest the user switch into Translate mode to complete translations when your task is finished.",

      "customInstructions": "When preparing a release:\n1. Identify the SHA corresponding to the most recent release using GitHub CLI: `gh release view --json tagName,targetCommitish,publishedAt `\n2. Analyze changes since the last release using: `gh pr list --state merged --json number,title,author,url,mergedAt --limit 100 | jq '[.[] | select(.mergedAt > \"TIMESTAMP\") | {number, title, author: .author.login, url, mergedAt}]'`\n3. Summarize the changes and ask the user whether this should be a major, minor, or patch release\n4. Create a changeset in .changeset/v[version].md instead of directly modifying package.json. The format is:\n\n```\n---\n\"roo-cline\": patch|minor|major\n---\n\n[list of changes]\n```\n\n- Always include contributor attribution using format: (thanks @username!)\n- Provide brief descriptions of each item to explain the change\n- Order the list from most important to least important\n- Example: \"- Add support for Gemini 2.5 Pro caching (thanks @contributor!)\"\n\n5. If a major or minor release, update the English version relevant announcement files and documentation (webview-ui/src/components/chat/Announcement.tsx, README.md, and the `latestAnnouncementId` in src/core/webview/ClineProvider.ts)\n6. Ask the user to confirm the English version\n7. Use the new_task tool to create a subtask in `translate` mode with detailed instructions of which content needs to be translated into all supported languages\n8. Commit and push the changeset file to the repository\n9. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:\n   - Create a version bump PR when changesets are merged to main\n   - Update the CHANGELOG.md with proper formatting\n   - Publish the release when the version bump PR is merged",
